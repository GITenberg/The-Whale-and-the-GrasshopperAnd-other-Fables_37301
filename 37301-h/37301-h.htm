<p class="first dropcap">When Padna Dan started talking to his friend
Micus Pat as they walked at a leisurely pace towards the town of
Castlegregory on a June morning, what he said was: &ldquo;The world is
a wonderful place when you come to think about it, and Ireland is a
wonderful place and so is America, and though there are lots of places
like each other, there&rsquo;s no place like Ballysantamalo. When
there&rsquo;s not sunshine there, there&rsquo;s moonshine, and the
handsomest women in the world live there, and nowhere else except in
Ireland or the churchyards could you find such decent
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decency,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re poor is
extravagance, and bad example when you&rsquo;re rich.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;because the poor imitate the
rich and the rich give to the poor and when the poor give to each other
they have nothing of their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s communism you&rsquo;re talking,&rdquo; said
Padna, &ldquo;and that always comes before education and enlightenment.
Sure, if the poor weren&rsquo;t decent they&rsquo;d be rich, and if the
rich were decent they&rsquo;d be poor, and if every one had a
conscience there&rsquo;d be less millionaires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a poor bird that can&rsquo;t pick for
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose a bird had a broken wing and couldn&rsquo;t fly
to where the pickings were?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then bring the pickings to him. That would be
charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But charity is decency and wisdom is holding your tongue when
you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the people of Ballysantamalo are so decent, how is it that
there are so many bachelors there? Do you think it right to have all
the young women <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>worrying their heads off reading trashy novels and
doing all sorts of silly things like fixing their hair in a way that
was never intended by nature and doing so for years and years and
having nothing in the end but the trouble of it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis hard blaming the young men because every
young lady you meet looks better to you than the last until you meet
the next, and so you go from one to another until you&rsquo;re so old
that no one would marry you at all unless you had lots of money, a bad
liver, and a shaky heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old man without any sense, lots of money, a bad liver, and
a shaky heart can always get a young lady to marry him,&rdquo; said
Micus, &ldquo;though rheumatics, gout, and a wooden leg are just as
good in such a case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every bit,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s
nothing like a weak constitution, a cold climate, and a tendency to
pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old men are queer,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;and if they were all only
half as wise as they think they are, then <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>there&rsquo;d be only young
fools in the world. I don&rsquo;t wonder a bit at the suffragettes. And
a time will come when we won&rsquo;t know men from women unless someone
tells us so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisha, &rsquo;tis my belief that there will be a great
reaction some day, because women will never be able to stand the strain
of doing what they please without encountering opposition. When a man
falls into love he falls into trouble likewise, and when a woman
isn&rsquo;t in trouble you may be sure that there&rsquo;s something
wrong with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;I think we will leave the
women where the Devil left St. Peter,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo; asked Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone,&rdquo; answered Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be all very fine if they stayed there,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;as I was talking of my travels
in foreign parts, I want to tell you about the morning I walked along
the beach at Ballysantamalo, and a warm morning it was too. So I ses to
meself, &lsquo;Padna Dan,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;what kind of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>fool of a man are you? Why don&rsquo;t you take a
swim for yourself?&rsquo; So I did take a swim, and I swam to the rocks
where the seals go to get their photographs taken, and while I was
having a rest for myself I noticed a grasshopper sitting a short
distance away and &lsquo;pon my word, but he was the most
sorrowful-looking grasshopper I ever saw before or since. Then all of a
sudden a monster whale comes up from the sea and lies down beside him
and ses: &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;is that you? Who&rsquo;d
ever think of finding you here! Why there&rsquo;s nothing strange under
the sun but the ways of woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis me that&rsquo;s here, then,&rsquo; ses the
grasshopper. &lsquo;My grandmother died last night and she wasn&rsquo;t
insured either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The practice of negligence is the curse of mankind and
the root of sorrow,&rsquo; ses the whale. &lsquo;I suppose the poor old
soul had her fill of days, and sure we all must die, and &rsquo;tis
cheaper to be dead than alive at any time. A man never knows that
he&rsquo;s dead when he is dead, and he never knows he&rsquo;s alive
until he&rsquo;s married.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6"
href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a great one to expatiate on things you
know nothing about like the barbers and the cobblers,&rsquo; said the
grasshopper. &lsquo;I only want to know if you&rsquo;re coming to the
funeral to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; ses the whale.
&lsquo;My grandfather is getting married for the tenth time and I was
in China on the last few occasions. I must pay my respects by being
present at to-morrow&rsquo;s festivities,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you can&rsquo;t come,&rsquo; ses the
grasshopper, &lsquo;because you are heartily welcome and you&rsquo;d
add prestige to the ceremony besides.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; ses the whale, &lsquo;but America
don&rsquo;t care much about ceremony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who told you that?&rsquo; ses the grasshopper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t I my eyesight, and don&rsquo;t I read
the newspapers?&rsquo; ses the whale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t read the society columns,
then,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, for the love of St. Crispin,&rsquo; ses the
whale, &lsquo;have they society columns in the American
newspapers?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed they have,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper,
&lsquo;and they oftentimes devote a few columns to other matters when
the dressmakers don&rsquo;t be busy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;America is a strange country surely, a wonderful
country, not to say a word about the length and breadth of it. I swam
around it twice last week without stopping, to try and reduce my
weight, and would you believe me that I was tired after the journey,
but the change of air only added to my proportions?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rsquo; ses the
grasshopper<span class="corr" id="xd20e399" title=
"Source: ?">.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you an American?&rsquo; ses the whale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course I am,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper. &lsquo;You
don&rsquo;t think &rsquo;tis the way I&rsquo;d be born at sea and no
nationality at all, like yourself. I&rsquo;m proud of my
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why, might I ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t we produce distinguished Irishmen,
and make Americans of the Europeans and Europeans of the Americans?
Think of all the connoisseurs who wouldn&rsquo;t buy a work of art in
their own country, when they could go to Europe and pay ten times the
value for the pot-boilers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href=
"#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>that does be turned out in the studios
of Paris and London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like home industry,&rsquo; ses
the whale, &lsquo;in a foreign country, I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;After all, who knows anything about a work of art but
the artist, and very little he knows about it either. A work of art is
like a flower; it grows, it happens. That&rsquo;s all. And unless you
charge the devil&rsquo;s own price for it, people will think you are
cheating them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, I suppose the best any one can do is to take
all you can get and if you want to be a philanthropist give away what
you don&rsquo;t want,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All worth missing I catches,&rsquo; ses the whale,
&lsquo;and all worth catching I misses, like the fisherman who lost the
salmon and caught a crab. How&rsquo;s things in Europe? I didn&rsquo;t
see the papers this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Europe is in a bad way,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper.
&lsquo;She was preaching civilization for centuries, so that she might
be prepared when war came to annihilate herself.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It looks that way to me,&rsquo; ses the whale.
&lsquo;Is there anything else worth while going on in the
world?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the Irish question,&rsquo; ses the
grasshopper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s that Ireland is?&rsquo; ses the whale.
&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that an island to the west of England?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper, &lsquo;but England is
an island to the east of Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha,&rsquo; ses the whale, &lsquo;it gives me
indigestion to hear people talking about Ireland. Sure, I nearly
swallowed it up by mistake while I was on a holiday in the Atlantic
last year, and I&rsquo;m sorry now that I didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry that you didn&rsquo;t try,&rsquo;
ses the grasshopper. &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;d know something about
indigestion. The less you have to say about Ireland, the less
you&rsquo;ll have to be sorry for. Remember that my father came from
Cork.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I say what I like?&rsquo; ses the
whale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can think what you like,&rsquo; ses the
grasshopper, &lsquo;but say what other people like if you want to be a
good politician.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing so much abused as
politics,&rsquo; ses the whale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Except politicians,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper.
&lsquo;Only for the Irish there&rsquo;d be no one bothering about
poetry and the drama to-day. Only for fools there&rsquo;d be no wise
people, and only for sprats, hake, and mackerel there&rsquo;d be no
whales, and a good job that would be too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re saying?&rsquo; ses the
whale very sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t have me to lose my temper with you,&rsquo;
ses the grasshopper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, bad luck to your impudence and bad manners, you
insignificant little spalpeen. How dare you insult your
superiors?&rsquo; ses the whale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s my superior?&rsquo; says the grasshopper.
&lsquo;You, is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, me then,&rsquo; says the whale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
no doubt but vanity, ignorance, and ambition are three wonderful
things, and you have them all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Another word from you,&rsquo; ses the whale,
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll put you where Napoleon put the oysters.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Neither you, nor Napoleon, nor the Kaiser himself and
his hundred million men could do hurt or harm to me. You could have
every soldier in the German army, the French army, and the Salvation
Army looking for me, and I&rsquo;d put the comether on them
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this any longer,&rsquo; ses the
whale, and then and there he hits the rock a whack of his tail, and
when I went to look for the grasshopper, there he was sitting on the
whale&rsquo;s nose as happy and contented as if nothing had happened.
And when he jumped back to the rock again, he says: &lsquo;A little
exercise when &rsquo;tis tempered with discretion never does any harm,
but violent exertion is a very foolish thing if you value your health.
But it is only people who have no sense, but think they have it all,
who make such errors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I could only get a hold of you,&rsquo; ses the
whale, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d knock some of the pride out of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That would be an ungentlemanly way of displaying your
displeasure,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d scorn,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;to use violent
means with you, or do you physical injury of any kind. All <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>you want
is self control and a little education. You should know that quantity
without quality isn&rsquo;t as good as quality without
quantity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure, &rsquo;tis I&rsquo;m the fool to be wasting my
time listening to the likes of you,&rsquo; ses the whale. &lsquo;If any
of my own family saw me now, I&rsquo;d never hear the end of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; ses the grasshopper, &lsquo;no one
belonging to me would ever recognise me ever again if they thought I
was trying to make a whale behave himself. There would be some excuse
for one of my attainments feeling proud. But as for
you&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what in the name of nonsense can you do except
give old guff out of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t time to tell you all,&rsquo; ses the
grasshopper. &lsquo;But to commence with, I can travel all over the
world and have the use of trains, steamers, sailing ships, and
automobiles and will never be asked to pay a cent, and I can live on
the dry land all my life if I choose, while you can&rsquo;t live under
water, or over water, on land or on sea, and while all the king&rsquo;s
horses and all the king&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13"
href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>men couldn&rsquo;t catch me if
they were trying till the crack of doom, you could be caught by a few
poor ignorant harmless sailors, who wouldn&rsquo;t know a crow from a
cormorant and who&rsquo;d sell your old carcass to make oil for foolish
wives to burn and write letters to other people&rsquo;s husbands and
fill the world with trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what about all the whalebone we supplies for
ladies&rsquo; corsets and paper knives, and what about all the stories
we make for the novelists and the moving pictures
and&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the Sprig of Holly now,&rdquo; said Micus.
&ldquo;Is it a pint of porter or a bottle of stout you&rsquo;ll
have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a pint, I think,&rdquo; said Padna.

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">The House in the Valley</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Down in the valley squirrels were busy climbing the
hazel trees; rabbits made bold and ventured from their hiding places to
gambol in the autumnal sunshine; weasels sported among the ferns; birds
sang and insects buzzed, while nature looked on and smiled. Larch,
birch, oak, and sycamore were altogether mingled, and perfect harmony
there was in bower and hedgerow. Everybody came to the valley and
everybody enjoyed coming, because there was no place like it. There was
no color that you could not find there; but if you searched all day and
all night too, only one house could you find in all its leafy splendor.
Nor was it a large house. Just two stories high, with medium-sized
windows below and small dormer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>windows on top. The roof was
made of thatch, and the thatch, from being bleached in the sun, had
turned to a golden hue. The walls, no one could tell what they were
made of, so well were they covered with ivy and other green creepers.
In the garden in front there were roses, pinks, and geraniums; and in
the garden behind, nasturtiums, money-musk, and golden feather grew on
a rockery made of large stones that were brought from Conlan&rsquo;s
Strand, where the children of Lir (before they became swans) used to
play and watch the great ships sailing over the seas. It was a
beautiful place to live, was this house, and whosoever looked upon it
never forgot the house in the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a wonderful place, surely!&rdquo; said a stranger, as
he looked down from a crag and surveyed the winding valley beneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A more wonderful place you could not find in a
lifetime,&rdquo; responded Micus Pat, as he lit his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Sure,
&rsquo;tis ten years of my life I&rsquo;d give to own that
house,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>as he pointed to where blue smoke was curling
skywards. &ldquo;Who built it at all, I&rsquo;d like to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down there,&rdquo; said Micus Pat, as he pointed to a
fallen tree, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this is what he told:</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it all happened when His Royal Highness the Czar of
Russia came on a visit to the Mayor of Cahermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been a long time ago,&rdquo; interrupted the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;But, as I was
saying, when His Royal Highness came to the town, there was great
excitement entirely. Every man, woman, and child put on their Sunday
clothes, and never before nor since was there such eating and drinking,
nor such dancing and singing. Flags were flying from the windows and
the housetops, and the birds in the cages and the birds in the trees
sang until they got so hoarse that they couldn&rsquo;t sing any more.
The Czar himself was delighted, and some say that he grew <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>two
inches taller from all he had seen: but he wasn&rsquo;t much of a man
at that. He was just an inch or so bigger than yourself, and maybe a
bit better looking, but who&rsquo;d be boasting about such things,
anyway? Well, though the Czar was neither big nor small, good looking
nor bad looking, all the Grand Dukes and Grand Duchesses were the sight
of the world. They too were delighted with themselves and everybody
else, and all went well until the Czar was making his speech, and Bryan
O&rsquo;Loughlin taking it down in shorthand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want taking down the speech for?&rdquo; said the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at your ignorance,&rdquo; said Micus.
&ldquo;Sure you ought to know that the Czar gets all his speeches
printed and gives them to his children to read during the cold wintry
nights in Russia. There&rsquo;s so much frost and snow there that His
Royal Highness never leaves his children run about the roads to warm
themselves, like other children, for fear of their getting chilblains
and toothaches.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18"
name="pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be a good father, then,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he is,&rdquo; said Micus, and he proceeded.
&ldquo;Well, the speech was wonderfully worded and loudly applauded,
and nearly ended, when a loud report rang out like as if some one was
trying to blow up the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord save us!&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;And when the silence was
resumed, some one shouted at the top of his voice. &lsquo;Anarchists!
Anarchists! Anarchists!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is an anarchist?&rdquo; asked the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An anarchist,&rdquo; answered Micus, &ldquo;is one who
don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with himself or the world, and
cares as little about his own life as he does about any one
else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of fools in the world, I&rsquo;m
thinking,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, thank God,&rdquo; replied Micus. &ldquo;Well, as
true as I&rsquo;m telling you, every one in the place took to their
heels when the great noise came, except Bryan O&rsquo;Loughlin and the
Czar himself. And if you looked out through the windows of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>the Town
Hall, you&rsquo;d see for miles and miles and miles along the roads
nothing but Grand Dukes and fair ladies, soldiers and sailors, and they
flying helter-skelter as though the Devil, or Cromwell himself, was
after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did the Czar himself say?&rdquo; queried the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The pusillanimous varmints,&rsquo; ses he, as he trod
the floor with disdain; and then, lo and behold! another blast rang
out, and the Czar with all his swords and medals fell into
Bryan&rsquo;s arms, and cried out! &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a dead man,&rsquo;
ses he. &lsquo;Bury me with my mother&rsquo;s people!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was no more dead than myself, for he only stepped on a
blank cartridge which was dropped by some of the Grand Dukes in the
scrummage for the doors&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what nearly took the
senses from His Royal Highness the Czar of Russia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when he came to himself some time after, he ses to
Bryan: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a brave man,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and you
must be rewarded for your valor,&rsquo; and Bryan felt as proud as the
Duke of Wellington <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20</a>]</span>and he after putting the comether on poor
Napoleon; and to show how little he cared for danger, he trod on every
cartridge he saw on the floor, and if you were there you&rsquo;d think
&rsquo;twas at the battle of Vinegar Hill you were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be careful,&rsquo; ses the Czar, &lsquo;one of them
cartridges might be loaded. I can see you are a brave man&rsquo; (and
he was too, for he was married three times, and he a widower, and he
but three and thirty). &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like
discretion,&rsquo; ses the Czar, &lsquo;if you want to keep alive and
out of trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of nothing,&rsquo; ses Bryan.
&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll always befriend a stranger in a foreign
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the Czar heard that, he ses: &lsquo;Bryan
O&rsquo;Loughlin of Cahermore, come here to me,&rsquo; and Bryan came.
&lsquo;Sit down there,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;while I fill my
pipe,&rsquo; and when his pipe was filled, he up and ses, as he drew a
lot of photographs from his pocket: &lsquo;These are my seven
daughters,&rsquo; ses he, and Bryan was delighted and surprised, so he
ses: &lsquo;And is their mother living too?&rsquo; &lsquo;She is,
indeed,&rsquo; says the Czar, and without <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>saying another word he
pulls her photograph out of another pocket, and when Bryan sees it, he
ses: &lsquo;&rsquo;Pon my word, she&rsquo;s a fine, decent, grauver
looking woman, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having her for a mother
myself, only she looks too like a protestant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She was the Duchess of Skatchachivouchi,&rsquo; ses
the Czar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that so? Well, then, she comes of a real decent
family,&rsquo; ses Bryan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; ses the Czar, &lsquo;I want to reward you
for your wonderful courage, so you can have your choice of my seven
daughters,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll make you Duke of
Siberia besides.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Bryan neither hummed nor hawed, and only asked him for
the fill of his pipe, and when both were puffing away together, ses
Bryan to the Czar: &lsquo;I can see you are a decent man, and I must
thank you for your kindness, and indeed I must say also that your
daughters are fine respectable-looking young women, and I&rsquo;m sure
that they would make good wives if they were well looked after. But I
promised my last wife, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span>and she on her dying bed, that I would never
marry any one again but the King of Spain&rsquo;s daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he had all that said, the Czar looked very sad, and
turned as pale as a ghost, and all he said was: &lsquo;Well, I
couldn&rsquo;t do any more for you,&rsquo; and then ses he: &lsquo;Is
there any place down here where we can have a drink?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is,&rsquo; said Bryan, &lsquo;down in the glen
at the Fox and Hounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So off they marched together, and after they treated each
other to three halfs of whiskey each, the Czar looked very tired and
forlorn, and said, as they made a short cut through St. Kevin&rsquo;s
boreen, and observed the clouds of night coming on from east and west,
and south and north, and not a friend nor an enemy in sight:
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;how the devil am I to reach the
shore in safety? I&rsquo;m a mighty monarch, and I must have a
bodyguard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To all this, and more besides, Bryan listened, but never a
word did he say until he smoked nearly all the Czar&rsquo;s tobacco,
and burnt all his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span>matches; and then all of a sudden he ses,
&lsquo;Leave it to me,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;I can get you a
bodyguard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt you,&rsquo; ses the Czar, as he
slipped him a guinea. &lsquo;You can have this,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;as you wouldn&rsquo;t have any of my daughters and be made the
Duke of Siberia. But we&rsquo;ll none the less be friends,&rsquo; ses
he. &lsquo;Life is a tragedy or a comedy according to the way you look
at it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The world&rsquo;s a stage,&rsquo; says Bryan,
&lsquo;but most of the actors don&rsquo;t know how to act: they are
only supers at best!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rsquo; ses the Czar. &lsquo;But what
about my bodyguard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of it,&rsquo; ses Bryan. &lsquo;Do
you know my brother Larry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; says the Czar, &lsquo;the pleasure
isn&rsquo;t mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a second corporal in the Ballygarvan
Lancers, and he&rsquo;s a great friend of the sergeant&rsquo;s, and
between us I think we can find a bodyguard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as true as I&rsquo;m telling you, after supper that night
the Czar of Russia marched through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24"
href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>the streets of Cahermore with a
bodyguard of the Ballygarvan Lancers behind and before him, and Bryan
out in front leading the way, with a gun on his shoulder and a sword by
his side, and everybody taking off their hats to him as he
passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened to the Czar?&rdquo; inquired the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went on board his warship and sacked all his generals,
admirals, and Grand Dukes, and when he went back to Russia, he sent
over his architect and masons to build a house for Bryan, and
that&rsquo;s the house in the valley beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was that the end of Bryan O&rsquo;Loughlin and the Czar
of Russia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Micus. &ldquo;Every Christmas his Royal
Highness used to send Bryan Christmas cards from himself and the wife
and children, and a box of blessed candles besides, and a bag of
birdseed for the linnets, and sweetpea seed for the garden also; and
there was no happier man in the whole world than Bryan till the day he
died. And that&rsquo;s the end of my story.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I think &rsquo;tis time to be going home now,&rdquo; said the
stranger. &ldquo;The swallows are flying low, and night will be
overtaking me before I will be over the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get wet, whatever you do,&rdquo; said Micus.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad for the rheumatics.&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What about the story you promised to tell me last
night?&rdquo; said Micus to his friend Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Draw your chair closer to the fire, and you&rsquo;ll hear
it,&rdquo; said Padna, and this is what he told:</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Moonlight was so called because of his love of
nocturnal rambling, and Peep o&rsquo; Day won his name because he rose
every morning to see the sun rising. Johnny and Peep were neighbors,
and it was no unusual thing for Johnny to meet Peep as he wended his
way home while Peep wended his way from it. Johnny was the more
loquacious of the two, and when Peep, who rose earlier than was his
wont, saw him watching the reflection of the moon in the placid waters
of Glenmoran Bay, he up and ses: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"
href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing at all, at all, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am watching the moonbeams glistening on the waters,&rdquo;
replied Johnny, &ldquo;and what greater pleasure could any man have and
all for nothing too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a glorious and a beautiful sight, surely, but the
greatest of all pleasures is to see the sun rising and to listen to the
birds singing in the bushes and to hear the cocks crowing and clapping
their wings, not to say a word about watching the flowers opening up
and drinking the morning dew. &rsquo;Tis in the morning that the world
rejoices, and in the morning we see the work of God everywhere, and
&rsquo;tis only in the darkness of the night that the badness comes
upon men. Everybody loves the morning, and all the poets have written
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be bothering me about the poets. I&rsquo;d rather
walk by the light of the moon through the glens and the woods, through
the winding boreens when the hawthorn and woodbine are in bloom, or by
the shore of the bay when the world does be sleeping, and have nothing
to disturb <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>my thoughts, except maybe a rabbit skedaddling
through the ferns, or a banshee wailing when some one gets killed in
the wars, than to see the sun breaking through the clouds at the grey
of dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lonesomeness and a queerness about the
beginning of everything, and &rsquo;twas always the shaky feeling that
came over me when I stayed out so late as to be caught by the rising
sun on the roadside. But every man is entitled to his own opinion until
he gets married, so we won&rsquo;t quarrel, because people who quarrel
are always sorry for the things they say and the things they forget to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t change a man&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo; said
Peep, &ldquo;unless you change himself, and then he&rsquo;d be some one
else and stick to his own opinion the same as any of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;and
there&rsquo;s nothing worse than truth except lies. People only tell
the truth when they are afraid of telling lies and then they must lie
about it before any one believes them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth will make lies all fall to pieces, but more lies will
patch them together again. So &rsquo;tis as good to be such a liar that
nobody believes you as to be so fond of the truth that no one would
trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisha, for goodness&rsquo; sake, do you think that I have
nothing else to do but getting my brains twisted trying to follow your
contrary reasoning, which only leads a sensible man into confusion and
bewilderment? What&rsquo;s the use of anything if you don&rsquo;t know
how to enjoy yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil the bit, and why people should go to the inconvenience
of annoying themselves in order to please nobody is more than I can
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If people could understand why they&rsquo;re sensible
they&rsquo;d become foolish, and if they could understand why
they&rsquo;re foolish they&rsquo;d become sensible. But as the wise and
the foolish will never know what&rsquo;s the matter with each other,
there will be always trouble in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be always trouble while women are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>allowed
to have their own way and their husbands&rsquo; money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sentiment in women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever, but they are all able to act and play any part
that the exigencies of the occasion may require, and that&rsquo;s
better than having an abundance of sentiment or any other quality that
hinders one&rsquo;s progress in a world of hypocrisy and
conventionality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the great flow of words you have, to be sure, not
to say a word about your common-sense. Was it from reading books that
you got all your knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t, indeed, but from observing the ways of all
the strange creatures on the face of the earth from man to the
ants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is a queer place. Nothing but war of some kind or
other while you&rsquo;re alive and peace only when you&rsquo;re dead,
and then there may be no peace either, for all we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis thinking I am that you&rsquo;re right, and if
you&rsquo;ll listen, I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened as I was
sauntering about by myself last night.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll listen, to be sure,&rdquo; said Peep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;as I was walking along by
the Faery Fort, I heard some one singing, so I quickened my pace and
came upon two strange looking gentlemen who were marching to the tune
of &lsquo;Home, Sweet Home.&rsquo; And when I ses: &lsquo;Good
night,&rsquo; they answered back and ses: &lsquo;Good night kindly,
sir,&rsquo; ses they. &lsquo;Who may we have the pleasure of talking
to?&rsquo; &lsquo;To Johnny Moonlight,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;And who may
I be talking to?&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know us,&rsquo; says
they altogether. &lsquo;Erra, of course I do,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;Who
would ye be but Oliver Cromwell and the Devil himself? And what may ye
be doing here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re on our way home after a trip to
Europe,&rsquo; ses the Devil, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;d be glad to have the
pleasure of your company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your kindness is embarrassing,&rsquo; ses I.
&lsquo;Indeed I couldn&rsquo;t think of accepting such
hospitality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you can go to Belgium for all I care,&rsquo; ses
the Devil. &lsquo;But clear out of me sight, anyway, or I&rsquo;ll hand
you over to me friend Oliver.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>So with that they sat
down on a ditch and commenced talking, and I stole up behind, and this
is what I heard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m homesick,&rsquo; ses Cromwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; ses the Devil, &lsquo;and disappointed
too. Europe is in a bad way, God help us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed it is, and I don&rsquo;t think we ought to tell
Napoleon anything about what we saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Twould only spoil his conceit to think that the
world could be in such a condition and he not there to share in the
glory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t talking about Napoleon I&rsquo;d
be, if I were you. Sure it&rsquo;s yourself has fallen on evil days.
You thought that you could have a nice quiet holiday for yourself in
Europe, but your nerves couldn&rsquo;t stand all the horrors of the
war, so you must needs hurry home to recuperate and look after your own
people,&rsquo; ses Cromwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can stand as much as you at any time,&rsquo; ses the
Devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you must not have read the history of
Ireland,&rsquo; ses Cromwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And if I didn&rsquo;t, do you think I&rsquo;d have you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>for a companion? I&rsquo;m as good a man as you
ever were,&rsquo; ses the Devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You may be as good,&rsquo; ses Cromwell, &lsquo;but
I&rsquo;ll acknowledge no superiority from you or any one
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It don&rsquo;t look well for us to be quarreling,
Oliver,&rsquo; ses the Devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true. We should always be a source of
comfort and consolation to each other. And we will, too. Indeed, it
isn&rsquo;t fair to us to have Ireland as she is these
times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong now?&rsquo; ses the Devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, nothing in particular,&rsquo; ses Cromwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ireland has always been a great bother to myself and
England,&rsquo; ses the Devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She has never helped us, more&rsquo;s the pity,&rsquo;
ses Cromwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And &rsquo;tis yourself made a great impression on the
minds of the Irish people,&rsquo; ses the Devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed and I did,&rsquo; ses Cromwell, &lsquo;and on
the English people too, and sure there&rsquo;s no one better known at
home than ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses the Devil, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis said
that a man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>only gets as much as he deserves, except when
he&rsquo;s married. And no man is a prophet in his own
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True!&rsquo; ses Cromwell. &lsquo;The eaten loaf is
soon forgotten, and the English people would forget me if they
could.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rsquo; says the Devil. &lsquo;The
Irish will never allow them to do that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose my memory will be always kept green by the
Irish,&rsquo; ses Cromwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; ses the Devil. &lsquo;Of course it
will. And what greater proof can you have of the inconsistency of
mankind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more consistent than man&rsquo;s
inconsistency,&rsquo; ses Cromwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Except woman&rsquo;s, of course,&rsquo; ses the Devil.
&lsquo;Sure I can&rsquo;t understand the creatures at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd20e739" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span>I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so,&rsquo;
ses Cromwell, &lsquo;because if we could understand them, there would
be no more surprises left for us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a wonderful memory, Johnny,&rdquo; said Peep,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be glad to hear the remainder <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>of your
story when the moon sails over the hills again. I&rsquo;ll be off now,
for the sun is rising, and I must be alone to enjoy myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God speed you,&rdquo; ses Johnny. &ldquo;Two is a crowd when
a man&rsquo;s feeling sleepy.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">The Valley of the Dead</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Large dark clouds, lined and fringed with a snowy
whiteness, were floating about in a starry sky, when Padna Dan vacated
his chair by the glowing hearth, where faggots blazed and a kettle
sang, and where his large black dog and small white cat lay asleep and
snored in chorus that made a strange harmony with the crackling of the
dried oak branches in the grate. When he reached the half door, the
moon was hiding behind a rift of cloud; and as he watched it emerge
from its hiding place and sail into a starlit region, he up and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure &rsquo;tis myself that&rsquo;s like the moon, with my
goings in and my comings out, and with my exits and my entrances, and
the glory that sometimes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>does be on my brow and the shadows
that at other times hide my face. Sometimes not a single thing hinders
my progress, from cock-crow to sundown, and other times everything
capable of disturbing a man&rsquo;s peace and quiet confronts me at
every turn. But, nevertheless, I manage to steer clear of all obstacles
and evade all that might upset me in any way, and show a smiling face
to the world, like the moon itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he filled a new clay pipe, that came all the way from
France, and was presented to him by his youngest granddaughter, as a
birthday gift, and sauntered along the boreen towards the Valley of the
Dead. And as he wended his lonely way, without looking to the right or
the left, and trampled down the tall grass that the sleeping cows, and
the sleeping sheep, and the sleeping donkeys were dreaming
about,&mdash;the very same tall grass that on the morrow they would
greedily feast on,&mdash;and as his footfalls startled wandering
rabbits, badgers, hares, and foxes, and they roaming from place to
place at the dead of night, he only thought of the world beyond the
stars <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>and of those who had gone to dwell there. And so
eerie an atmosphere did he create about himself that he might have been
a fairy or an elf without care or sorrow for the past or future, but a
love of the things that be. And not until he reached the top of a high
hill, from which he could see in the moonlight the towering spires of
distant churches, where a red light is always kept burning before the
high altars, did he stand and rest. And he did not sit down until he
found a comfortable seat on a projecting ledge of rock, overlooking a
long winding valley covered with larch and beech trees, sloe and
crabapple, and all kinds of thorny underwood.</p>
<p>The rising mist, as it spread through the trees along the serpentine
course of the valley, seemed like some fabulous monster devouring all
that came in its way. And as he sat with his feet dangling in the air,
the sound of familiar footsteps caused him to look from the mist to
where the sound came from near by. And lo and behold! whom did he see
but his old friend Micus. And what he said, before Micus had time to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>say anything at all, or get over his surprise,
was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well! Who&rsquo;d ever think of meeting any one
at the dead of night like this? And the stars themselves nearly hidden
by the dark clouds, that are drifting about in the spacious and
likewise wondrous sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure &rsquo;tis disappointed as well as surprised that I am,
to find any one but myself out of doors, and the whole world on its
knees, so to speak, praying for the dead,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is All Souls&rsquo; Night, of course,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the Night of All Souls, if you will,&rdquo; said Micus.
&ldquo;And sure, &rsquo;tis we that are the queer creatures entirely,
and we that does be praying for the dead and not caring a traneen about
the living, unless, maybe, when we can take advantage of their decency
and generosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true, indeed, &rsquo;tis true! Though &rsquo;tis
with shame that I must admit it. However, don&rsquo;t leave any one
hear you saying so but myself,&rdquo; said Padna. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And who would hear me at all?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, any one of the people who will be marching down the
road when the fairies will go to their homes in the mountains,&rdquo;
said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when will that be?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the clocks will strike the midnight hour,&rdquo; said
Padna. &ldquo;Then all the dead will arise from their graves, and march
along the road to the Valley of the Dead, beyond, and return from
whence they came before to-morrow&rsquo;s sun will emblazon the east
with its dazzling light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at that,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be surprised at nothing,&rdquo; said Padna.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s if you want to maintain a solid equanimity. But
hold your tongue for a while, and cast your eye along the valley, and
watch the mist gathering on the furze and sloe trees. And in a minute
or two, the moon will come from behind a cloud, and the most glorious
sight that ever met the gaze of man will unfold itself before you. The
mist will soon cover all the trees, and you will see nothing at all but
one long serpentine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41"
name="pb41">41</a>]</span>trail of vapour, into which all the armies of
the dead will plunge with a wild fury that will make every hair on your
head stand on end and nearly freeze the very marrow in your bones with
cold fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s all the hurry about; why won&rsquo;t they
take their time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;From life to
death is but a step, and we must follow some master or be driven by
another until the threshold of eternity is crossed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the clock of some distant church striking the midnight
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. And I can see the army of the dead
approaching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil a one of me can see anything or any one, except a
fox scampering through the boreen beyond, with a water hen in his
mouth,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, look,&rdquo; said Padna, as he pointed with the stem of
his pipe. &ldquo;There they come: all the people who dwelt on this holy
island since God made the world, and man made mistakes. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>I can
see them all. There&rsquo;s Brian Boru&rsquo;s army, with Brian himself
out in front, and he holding the golden crucifix the same as he carried
it to battle when he drove the Danes from our shores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see him at all,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, there he is mounted on the black charger that trampled
and crushed to death the valorous invaders who were foolish enough to
come in his way. Look, how he prances and shakes his mane and sniffs
the air. He was the King of all the black horses, and when he was shot
through the heart by an arrow, his spirit flew away to the world beyond
the fleecy clouds, but, as it could never rest, it came back to earth
again, and now dwells in all the black horses of the world. And they,
each and every one, are pledged to avenge the death of Brian and his
war steed. So if ever you see a black horse on a lonely road or crowded
street, with a fiery look in his eye, keep out of his way unless you
love Granuaile, or he will trample you with his iron hoofs until you
are dead.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see neither horses nor men,&rdquo; persisted Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all passing into the valley now, and I can see the
soldiers keeping step to the music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they playing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would they be playing, but Brian Boru&rsquo;s march, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard a sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear the war pipes and the stamp of the
soldiers&rsquo; feet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear no sound at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most wonderful music. It filled the hearts of the Irish
soldiers with courage, the like of which astonished mankind, and drove
terror into the hearts of the invaders as they ran to the sea and got
drowned. It fills me with courage now, and will instil valour into
every Irish heart until the crack of doom. Don&rsquo;t you hear it
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I hear nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It grows fainter and fainter,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;The
army is now in the valley but &lsquo;twill return when winter gives way
to spring, and spring gives way to summer, and when summer gives way to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>autumn, and when All Souls&rsquo; Night will come
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Christmas daisies wither, and when the daffodils and
the bog lilies and the blue-bell and the hyacinth bloom again, and when
the gooseberry and black-currant bushes are laden down with fruit, and
when the green leaves turn to brown and the autumnal breeze scatters
them on the roadside, we may be dead ourselves,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;here come all the bards and
minstrels that loved poor Granuaile, and sang her praises, on the
mountain side, on the scaffold, behind prison bars, at home and in
distant lands. At morning and at evening, at noon and at night, in
early youth and at the brink of the grave. And sad they all look
too,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is a sad place for those who can see sorrow,&rdquo;
said Micus. &ldquo;Granuaile herself is sad, because for centuries she
has lived in sorrow. She weeps for her own sons and the sons of all
nations. She wakes with a smile in the morning, but when the dark cloak
of night is flung on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=
"#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>world, her eyes are always filled
with tears. And when nobody does be looking, she weeps, and weeps, and
weeps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for the sins of men she weeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for the contrariness of women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for the folly of children, whether they be grown up with
beards upon their chins, or in their teens and staying up the nights
writing love letters for their philandering sweethearts to laugh at and
show to their worthless friends so that they may do
likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granuaile is the Queen of Beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of valour, and of purity, and of goodness. All her lovers
are coming along the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Parnell there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, he&rsquo;s there. And he with a look of melancholy
on him that would melt a stone to tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Granuaile broke his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granuaile would break any one&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Parnell hated England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he loved Ireland! And never forgot her wherever he
travelled.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46"
name="pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Irish are the great travellers, and it would seem indeed
that the world itself is too small for them. Who else do you
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see St. Patrick himself, and all the holy bishops, and they
looking as respectable, and as contented and as prosperous as
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas they that saved us from Paganism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. But &rsquo;twas religion that kept Granuaile
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis as well, maybe. Who&rsquo;d be rich and with power
enough to cripple Christianity, like others, just for the sake of
saying that one race or one country was better than another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man will never get real sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until he loses his pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his arrogance and his selfishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking at now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking at anything in particular, but watching
to see my great, great, great grandaunt Helen of Aughrim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was the most beautiful of all womankind.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she passed by unknownst to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has not passed yet. I could recognise her by her queenly
gait. They say she was the most beautiful woman that ever lived and had
as may lovers as Granuaile herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whom did she marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is her story then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll listen,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have already told you, for beauty and elegance there was
never the likes of Helen of Aughrim, and though every one who laid eyes
on her fell in love, she never fell in love with any one at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who did she like best of the lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice the Rover. And when he was a young man of three
sevens, he up and ses to her: &lsquo;Helen&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;will
you marry me?&rsquo; But she said she would wed no man, and told him to
search the whole wide world for some one more beautiful. So he sailed
away that very hour, and for seven years he travelled, and travelled,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>travelled, up hill and down dale, but could find
no one more beautiful. And then he returned and told her his story. But
all she said when she heard it, was: &lsquo;Try again,&rsquo; ses she.
And away over the seas he sailed again, and searched until seven more
years had passed away, and he returned again, and he said,
&lsquo;Helen&rsquo;; but she interrupted and ses: &lsquo;I know what
you are going to say,&rsquo; ses she. &lsquo;But all I can say to you,
is try again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he came and went every seven years, only to get the
same answer, and the years passed, and his hair turned white, and his
eyes grew dim, and the stateliness of Helen&rsquo;s figure disappeared,
and deep lines were on her brow, and once again, he up and ses:
&lsquo;Helen,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;will you marry me?&rsquo; And for
the first time her eyes filled with tears, and she ses: &lsquo;You are
a faithful lover,&rsquo; ses she, &lsquo;and I will marry you on the
morrow.&rsquo; But when he came on the morrow, she was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a true story?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, &rsquo;tis a true story. I can see them
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>now walking along the road arm in arm. And
&rsquo;tis seven years ago since I saw them before, and &lsquo;twill be
seven years before I will see them again. But they will walk along the
road to the Valley of the Dead every seven years, until the stars fall
from the sky and time is no more,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is a wonderful thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful thing, surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a faithful lover is the dearest treasure of
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without love, there is no life, for its roots are centered in
the heart of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without love the world would wither up, and every plant and
shrub and flower would die. And when I die, I hope I will be with my
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while I live, I hope that I will be with mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friendship is a great thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is greater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you waiting here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all. The last of the great army <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>has
passed into the Valley, and I will go home and pray for the
dead,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will go home and pray for the living,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, you mean,&rdquo; said Micus. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The King of Montobewlo</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Padna Dan to his friend
Micus Pat, as they strolled along a country road together, &ldquo;if
you ever heard the story of the King of Montobewlo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the blazes is or was the King of Montobewlo?&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King of Montobewlo was such a man as you only meet once
in a lifetime, and if you will only hold your tongue and keep quiet, I
will tell you all about him,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue, of course,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;the King of Shonahulu was
getting old and cranky, and the poor devil suffered badly from
frost-bite and rheumatics besides; so he up and ses to Hamando, who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>was his chief cook and private secretary:
&lsquo;Hamando,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I think I must have a change in
my dietary. What have you for dinner to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have nothing in the way of dainties,&rsquo; ses
Hamando. &lsquo;The last missionary was boiled with the cabbage
yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rsquo; ses the King.
&lsquo;There seems to be a great scarcity of missionaries in these
parts lately. I wonder whatsomever can be the reason at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There must be some reason,&rsquo; ses Hamando,
&lsquo;because there is a reason for everything, even for unreasonable
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a fact, bedad,<span class="corr" id=
"xd20e979" title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> ses the King, as he
killed a mosquito on Hamando&rsquo;s nose with a cudgel, and stretched
poor Hamando flat on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha,&rsquo; ses Hamando, as he picked himself up
after the unmerciful clout he got, &lsquo;I suppose it must be the way
the English people are learning sense at last and keeping them at home
to look after the suffragettes, or else that England has as much land
as she is able to control.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53"
href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think that can be the reason,&rsquo; ses
the King. &lsquo;What does it matter to England whether she can control
a place or not, so long as she owns it. Take Ireland, for
instance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, bedad,&rsquo; ses Hamando. &lsquo;England can
blunder magnificently when dealing with Irish affairs. And her
wonderful stupidity has lost her not only all the Irish in America, but
the Irish in other countries as well. However, the English are a
far-seeing and a very polite class of people, and that&rsquo;s why they
send out pious and well-meaning missionaries to lay the foundation
stones, so to speak, of the Empire beyond the seas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True,&rsquo; ses the King. &lsquo;And &rsquo;tis an
ill wind that blows nobody good, as the Devil said when the forty
tinkers of Ballinderry were lost at sea. Nevertheless, there&rsquo;s no
one likes the missionaries better than ourselves, even though I do say
so myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very true, indeed,&rsquo; ses Hamando.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By the way,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;was the last
one we had for dinner a Scotchman or a Welshman?&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; ses Hamando. &lsquo;He
spoke like a Yorkshireman, but he tasted like a Dutchman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired of foreigners like the Dutch,&rsquo;
ses the King, &lsquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having an Irishman for
dinner to-day if you could secure one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s an Irishman to be
had for love, money, or an argument,&rsquo; ses Hamando.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense, man,&rsquo; ses the King. &lsquo;Do you
think &rsquo;tis in Jupiter or Mars you are? There&rsquo;s only one
place where you can&rsquo;t find an Irishman, and you&rsquo;d find one
there too, only the Devil likes to have his own way in all matters. But
no more old palaver, and search my dominions at once, and if you
can&rsquo;t find an Irishman, I&rsquo;ll make vegetarians of each and
every one of my loyal subjects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to oblige you,&rsquo; ses
Hamando, and away he went to the Prince of Massahala, who was also
Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and Secretary for the Colonies, and
there and then the Prince gathered his army of ten hundred <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>thousand
men, and searched the mountains, and the valleys, and the caves and the
hills, and the towns and the villages, but no trace of an Irishman
could he find. And when he returned and told the story of his exploits
and adventures to the King, there was never such ructions on land or
sea. The King, who was never a man of mild disposition, nearly exploded
from the sheer dint of anger, and he up and ses as his eyes bulged out
of their sockets: &lsquo;Do you mean to tell me that there isn&rsquo;t
a single Irishman to be had in all my dominions?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve searched high up and low down, but
couldn&rsquo;t find a trace of one anywhere,&rsquo; ses the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Was it the way you were all blindfolded?&rsquo; ses
the King, and he looked as though he was about to hand them over to the
State Executioner, and order their skins to be sold for making gloves
for the ladies of Paris, Ballingeary, and the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are there any Jews within the borders of my
territory?&rsquo; ses he. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are two Jews for every fool in the
community,&rsquo; ses the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;there must be
an Irishman about somewhere. And I&rsquo;m thinking there is a leak in
your memory, or else your education was sorely neglected. You should
know at this hour of your life, if you know anything at all, that the
Irish race was destined by Providence to make things easy for mankind
in general, but the Jews in particular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Prince heard this, he told his men to get ready for
the road, and he marched at the head of his army to where the Jews were
located, and sure enough, there he found the one and only Irishman in
the whole country, and he brought him before the King. And when the
King laid his optics on him, he up and ses: &lsquo;Holy smoke and
tailors&rsquo; trimmings,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;where did you bring
that red head from?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the Irishman, &lsquo;I never even asked
myself that question, but I dare say I must have brought it from
Denmark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From Denmark?&rsquo; ses the King with surprise.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses the Irishman; &lsquo;&rsquo;twas my
great-grandfather&rsquo;s great-grandfather&rsquo;s
great-grandfather&rsquo;s father who killed Brian Boru at the Battle of
Clontarf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that a fact?&rsquo; ses the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a solid fact,&rsquo; ses Cormac McDermot,
for that was his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, be the seven pipers of Ballymacthomas,&rsquo;
ses the King, &lsquo;that bates Bannagher. The man who killed Brian
Boru was no slaumeen, by all accounts. And I like nothing better, when
my day&rsquo;s work is done, than to read the exploits of Brian, and
his compatriots the Knights of the Red Branch, for herself and the
children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you fond of reading?&rsquo; ses Cormac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing gives me more pleasure,&rsquo;
ses the King, &lsquo;except teaching my chef to cook a Scotchman, and
&rsquo;tis as hard to catch as &rsquo;tis to cook one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have heard of a Scotchman who was caught one
time,&rsquo; ses Cormac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When he was dead, I suppose,&rsquo; ses the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses Cormac. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The time is flying, and a man gets hungry, and angry
likewise, and there you are gabbing away, and myself waiting for dinner
for the last three hours, and you showing no consideration for me at
all. What way would you like to be cooked?&rsquo; ses the King.
&lsquo;You must be killed first, of course, though sometimes we does
the cooking and the killing together, without as much as wasting a word
about it. Howsomever, I am always lenient to the Irish, for I have an
English strain in my temperament, and that&rsquo;s why I am giving you
your choice in the matter of cooking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, bedad, to tell the truth, I&rsquo;m not a bit
particular about the cooking, but I am a trifle concerned about the
killing. And before you will send me to my grave, I would like your
Majesty to grant me one request,&rsquo; ses Cormac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; ses the King, as he
looked at his watch, for he was getting hungry and impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis that I will be allowed to sing my swan
song, so to speak, before I will die.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sing away to your heart&rsquo;s content,&rsquo; ses
the King. And the words were no sooner spoken than Cormac commenced to
sing &lsquo;The Valley Lay Smiling Before Me,&rsquo; and when he
finished the last verse, there wasn&rsquo;t a dry handkerchief in the
multitude that gathered around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;that was well sung,
and we&rsquo;ll have &ldquo;The Bard of Armagh,&rdquo; now, if you
please. &rsquo;Twas my poor mother&rsquo;s favourite song.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when Cormac finished, the King shook hands with him and
thanked him for his singing and in the same breath said
&lsquo;good-by&rsquo; as he was in a hurry to have him cooked for
supper. Well, there wasn&rsquo;t much of the fool about Cormac, so he
up and ses to the King: &lsquo;If I am causing your Majesty any
inconvenience, I am sorry, but as one good turn deserves another, I
think it is only fair to tell you that whoever eats even the smallest
piece of myself, either raw or cooked, will immediately be turned into
a tombstone like you&rsquo;d see at Monasterboice. And after
four-and-twenty hours, shamrocks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60"
href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>will sprout on them, and then a
great wind will spring up and scatter the leaves of the shamrock all
over your territory, and whenever a leaf will fall on any of your
subjects, they will be instantly turned into Irishmen, and then may the
Lord have mercy on the foreigners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it the truth you are telling, you foxy
rascal?&rsquo; ses the King, and he looks very uneasy too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me, why don&rsquo;t you
kill me and find out?&rsquo; ses Cormac. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m nearly tired
of living anyway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King got the fright of his life when he heard what Cormac
said, and never another word did he utter about the killing or the
cooking either, but ses he, when he recovered: &lsquo;Give us another
song,&rsquo; ses he, and then and there Cormac started &lsquo;Then
You&rsquo;ll Remember Me,&rsquo; and the King was so much impressed
that he told Hamando to fetch some tea, biscuits, and missionary
sandwiches, for he thought Cormac was looking fatigued. And when Cormac
ate the biscuits, drank the tea, but refused the sandwiches, because
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>it was Friday, he thanked the King for his
thoughtfulness, and said that he was glad to see His Majesty upholding
the true Christian principles by treating his enemies with such
consideration. &lsquo;Anyway,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis always
good policy to be on friendly terms with your enemies, or those who are
likely to become your enemies. But always beware of diplomats,&rsquo;
ses he, &lsquo;because diplomacy is only a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s
clothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rsquo; ses the King, as he sharpened
a pencil and drew a map of his dominions. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to make you a little present,&rsquo; and there
and then he cut off three-fourths of his country and gave it to Cormac.
&lsquo;You can plant a hedge of skeeory bushes to divide our lands, and
I will now make you King of Montobewlo, in presence of Hamando and
myself. And I&rsquo;ll appoint you General Inspector of Cruelty to
Animals, Children, and Insects besides. But,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;it
is absolutely necessary that you should become a real black man first,
so you might as well strip off now, and have yourself washed in Injun
ink, and you can send your old clothes to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>the King of Portugal,
because he is out of a job at present, and it may be a long time before
he gets one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be only too pleased to send him my old
clothes,&rsquo; ses Cormac, &lsquo;because &rsquo;tis only right that
kings should help each other, and have benefit societies like the
bricklayers, and the market gardeners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when Cormac was washed in a tub of Injun ink, he was
the purtiest-looking black man that ever was seen. And when his
innumerable subjects saw his bulging muscles and red head, they were so
impressed that some of them died of shock, but Cormac, like the decent
man he was, had them all buried with military honours. His coronation
was the grandest affair that ever was, and when the ceremony was all
over, the King up and ses to him: &lsquo;Cormac, King of
Montobewlo,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;how many wives do you want? Three
hundred or three thousand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ten thousand thanks for your kind offer,&rsquo; ses
Cormac, &lsquo;but for the good of my nerves, and my people in general,
I think I&rsquo;ll remain a bachelor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>Of course,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;wives are only women anyway, and where there are women there is
jealousy, and where there&rsquo;s jealousy there is trouble.
Women,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;are all right to look at, but they are
best when left alone. It will give me all I can do to look after the
affairs of state, without bothering or trying to find out which of my
wives might be telling the truth. But nevertheless,&rsquo; ses he, as
he took a scissors and clipped several slips of his red locks,
&lsquo;you can distribute these among the ladies as a token of my
regards and friendship. And now,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;to show I
harbour no ill feelings, if you want any more, I will be only too
delighted to give what I can spare for planting on any of my subjects
with bald heads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so the days and the years slipped away, until he got as
fat as a cow in clover from eating whales, elephants, and cockroaches.
Then great wisdom came upon him, and he up and ses to the King one day,
after they searched the whole country for a Jew, and couldn&rsquo;t
find one, for they all emigrated to the United States to look after
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>the Irish: &lsquo;Economy,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;is one of the fundamental principles of good government, and
that being so, let us put it into practice. We are getting old,&rsquo;
ses he, &lsquo;and the missionaries come here no longer. And we have
eaten all the produce of the land in the way of live stock, but
nevertheless our subjects must be provided for. Now,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;I propose that all over fifty years of age should be killed,
boiled or roasted, as the case may be, according to law, for the
maintenance, sustenance, and nourishment of the others. Anybody over
fifty years, unless he be a policeman or a king, isn&rsquo;t much good
constitutionally or otherwise; and as all our subjects are the property
of the government, there is no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t do what we
like with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course, we can do what we please with them, and I
think you deserve a raise in your wages for conceiving such a wonderful
idea,&rsquo; ses the King. &lsquo;Not only would we do our people a
great justice by providing them with the very best kind of victuals,
but we would save them funeral expenses besides.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rsquo; ses Cormac, &lsquo;and any
true philosopher must know that &rsquo;tis better that we should eat
each other than that the worms should eat us. Anyway,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;&rsquo;twill be all the same in a hundred years, as the Duke of
Argyle said to the Leprechaun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the new law was duly enforced, and the age limit
reduced to suit circumstances, and in less than ten years there
wasn&rsquo;t any one left but Cormac and the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedad, that&rsquo;s a strange story,&rdquo; said Micus.
&ldquo;I knew that an Irishman could become anything from a poet to a
policeman, but I never heard of one becoming a cannibal
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cormac didn&rsquo;t become a cannibal at all,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did he escape?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He escaped by becoming a vegetarian the very day the law came
into force,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;He just wanted to go home to
Ireland, and he was afraid he&rsquo;d have an uneasy conscience, if any
of his subjects were left exposed to the dangers of a foreign country,
and that was how he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66"
name="pb66">66</a>]</span>secured peace of mind before shaking the dust
of Montobewlo off his heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened to the King?&rdquo; asked Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he was seeing Cormac off by the good ship
<i>Ennisferric</i> that was bound for Cork&rsquo;s fair city, he
slipped off the gangway, and when they went to look for him, they could
only find a crocodile in the throes of indigestion,&rdquo; said Padna.

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; asked Micus.
&ldquo;Surely you know your way to the hearth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t, I ought,&rdquo; said Padna, as he walked
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>in, closed the door, and occupied a vacant chair
beside Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought you out to-night, at all?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisha, nothing in particular, except that I have a story to
tell you,&rdquo; replied Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; said Micus, as he placed
some faggots and turf on the fire. &ldquo;Draw closer and get the
benefit of the heat, and you will feel better while you are telling the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Padna, as he moved his chair, and then
he lit his pipe with one of the paper pipe-lights that lay on the
mantel shelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a story of love or adventure that I am about to
hear?&rdquo; asked Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a story of both,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin then,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Padna. And this is what he told:</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, and not very long ago either, there lived a
man, a friend of mine, and known to all as one Matty the Goat from
Ballydineen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>He wasn&rsquo;t much to look at, God help us! but
he was a remarkable man, nevertheless. He always tried to live in peace
and quietness, but he had two wives, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he have two wives in an old-fashioned country like
this, might I ask?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;his first wife had a bad
memory, and she forgot she was married, and one fine day she went away
to Australia to see the kangaroos, and remained away so long that Matty
thought she was dead, or captured by some traveling showman, to be
exhibited in a circus, because she was so ugly and bad-tempered, no one
else would think of running away with her. So like all men of
susceptible and sentimental propensities, his affection for his first
love only lasted until he met the second. Of course, when the years
passed, and there were no tidings of his wife, he said to himself that
he might as well marry again, and accordingly he did so. Well, lo and
behold! he was only about twelve months married, and his second wife
was beginning to cut down his rations from three boiled duck eggs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>every morning to one small hen egg that a wren
would be ashamed to lay, when a great calamity befell him. His first
wife came back, and she less attractive looking than ever. But to be
sure she made all the excuses and apologies, as only a woman can, for
her lapse of memory and thoughtlessness, and there and then she abused
poor Matty for not writing to her and sending cards at Christmas and
Easter, and he not knowing where to find her at all, no more than a
crow could find his grandmother. But to make a long story as short as a
bulldog&rsquo;s temper, poor Matty nearly lost his senses between his
two wives, and one only more unreasonable than the other, and the two
together less reasonable than any ordinary person, who would have no
sense at all. &lsquo;So,&rsquo; ses Matty to himself, &lsquo;what, in
the name of all that&rsquo;s ridiculous, am I to do now? If I&rsquo;ll
stay here in the town, I&rsquo;ll be arrested and imprisoned for having
two wives, but that itself would be better than trying to please either
one or the other, not to mention both. And if I&rsquo;ll run away
I&rsquo;ll be arrested for deserting them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>And if
either the law of the land, or my conscience had no power over me, and
I tried to live with both, I&rsquo;d be as mad as a March hare in less
than a month. Anyway, &rsquo;tis a clear case of being obliterated by
circumstances over which one has no control. That&rsquo;s the last
consolation a man always offers himself when he cannot get out of a
difficulty. There is but one thing for me to do now, and that is to
commit suicide by ending my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he made that decision he came to me and ses:
&lsquo;Padna,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I have made up my mind to take the
shortest cut to the other world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it,&rsquo; ses
I. &lsquo;People who have pluck enough to commit suicide usually have
too much pride to boast of it beforehand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t boast or talk of it
afterwards,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true, too,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;But when
is the event going to come off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say for certain,&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;But &lsquo;twill <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>be as soon as ever I can make up my
mind whether New York or Boston would be the best place for me to end
my days, and maybe &rsquo;tis yourself that could give advice, and tell
me what to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;giving advice is
oftentimes as foolish as taking it. However, that&rsquo;s too weighty a
problem for a poor man like myself. You must consult some one with more
sense. But if I were you, I&rsquo;d see the King of Spain himself about
the matter. He is the one man who I think can help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea,&rsquo; ses he. And with
that he bid me &lsquo;Good day,&rsquo; and on the morrow he set sail in
a full-rigged ship for the sunny land of Spain. And when he reached the
Royal Palace, and rang the bell, the King himself opened the door, and
he dressed in a smoking cap, and puffing away from a clay pipe that his
mother brought from Bantry when she was there for the good of her
manners. And before he asked Matty who he was, how he was, or what he
wanted, he up and ses: &lsquo;Have you a match?&rsquo; ses he.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To be sure I have a match,&rsquo; ses Matty. And there
and then, he struck a match on the heel of his shoe and lit the
King&rsquo;s pipe. And when the King thanked him for his kindness, and
complimented him on his skill, then ses he: &lsquo;Who the blazes are
you anyway to disturb a decent man after a hard day&rsquo;s work? I ate
no less than five dinners this blessed day and as many more breakfasts,
not to mention all the tobacco that I smoked besides, since I got out
of bed this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;I am one Matty the Goat.
My father kept a tailor&rsquo;s shop at the corner of a street in
Ballydineen; I have two brothers policemen in the great United States
of America; I have a first cousin married to a schoolmaster in the
north of Antrim; five of my ancestors died from the whooping cough, and
one of my grandaunts fell down-stairs and broke her neck;
my&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Enough!&rsquo; ses the King. &lsquo;Wait there till I
get my autograph book.&rsquo; And with that he ran up-stairs, and when
he came back he handed Matty a mighty book all bound in green plush
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>and ses: &lsquo;Matty of Ballydineen,&rsquo; ses
he, &lsquo;put your name down there beside the names of the Emperor of
Japan and the King of the Killavullen Islands.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd20e1193" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>And when his name was written, the King
rang for the Queen and all the children, and in a twinkling they
appeared, and they dressed as well as any of the young ladies
you&rsquo;d see selling knick-knacks behind a counter in one of the
shops of the big cities. And as they gathered around the King, he up
and ses with a solemn voice: &lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rsquo; ses
he, &lsquo;allow me to have the pleasure of presenting to you a member
of the Ballydineen aristocracy, one Matty the Goat.&rsquo; And when the
ceremony of introduction was all over, he sent them up-stairs to get
their autograph books, so that Matty could contribute his signature to
the long list of celebrities and distinguished personages. The Queen
herself was delighted with him entirely, and the King invited him to
his private room. And when they were comfortably seated before a good
warm fire, he up and ses: &lsquo;What in the name of all the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>cockroaches in Carrigmacross brought you here,
anyway?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A very serious matter, indeed,&rsquo; ses Matty.
&lsquo;I came to look for advice. I am a man with no less than two
wives, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me any more till I give you a drop of
the best whiskey,&rsquo; ses the King. And with that he filled a glass
for Matty and another for himself, and ses: &lsquo;There is only one
worse thing that could happen a man, and that is to have three wives,
or half a dozen foolish sisters-in-law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;I am about to commit
suicide, and the devil blast the one of me can make up my mind whether
Boston or New York would be the best place to hang my carcass to a
lamp-post, jump off a high building, or throw myself under a motor car
going at full speed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
something that requires consideration. But let us talk the matter over.
Two heads, like two dollars, are better than one, and &rsquo;twas by
talking and thinking, and holding commune with each other that the
Greeks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>achieved so much in the olden times. We will take
the case of Boston first. Boston I believe is a great place and
&rsquo;tis called the Hub of the Universe. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is, God help us!&rsquo; ses Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder why at all?&rsquo; ses the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think that any one really knows,&rsquo;
ses Matty, &lsquo;unless that it is as good a title as any other, and
maybe somewhat better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the case,&rsquo; ses the King,
&lsquo;now&rsquo;s the chance for some one to make a discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A man, I presume,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;could live
very comfortably in Boston if he had a lot of money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed, he could,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;and live
there without any money, if he was lucky enough to be a dethroned
monarch of some kind or other, or the inventor of a new
religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The invention of new religions,&rsquo; ses the King,
&lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t seem to beget a spirit of communism, nor does it
seem to bring us any nearer Christianity in its ideal state. All the
same, I suppose a large city like Boston must have a mayor to look
after himself and his people.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course, Boston has a mayor and an ex-mayor
too,&rsquo; ses Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;as sure as there
are bones in a sprat, that must be the reason why &rsquo;tis called the
Hub. And I dare say,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;they must have poets in
Boston also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They have,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;in the
churchyards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the best place for them,&rsquo; ses the
King. &lsquo;They will be more respected and appreciated there than
anywhere else. Besides, &rsquo;tis wiser, cheaper, and more cultured to
patronize poets and philosophers when they are dead and famous, than to
run the risk of being ridiculed for having the wit to recognise them
while they are alive. A poet, God help us, seldom does any good for
himself, but nevertheless he can always be an advantage to posterity,
his relations, and the booksellers, after he is dead long enough to be
misunderstood,&rsquo; ses the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the devil of a thing to be poor,&rsquo; ses
Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not at all, man,&rsquo; ses the King. &lsquo;Poverty,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>as the Cardinal said to the Hibernians, is a gift
of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A gift of God?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t much of a gift,&rsquo;
ses Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t
think of comparing it to the gift of stupidity, which is the greatest
of all gifts, especially when &rsquo;tis accompanied by an optimism
that nothing could disturb but the gift of poverty itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But be all that as it may,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;no
one should give anything away for nothing without making sure that they
are going to get something for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, if that wouldn&rsquo;t make an optimist of a
man, nothing would,&rsquo; ses the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is an optimist?&rsquo; ses Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An optimist,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;is a
pessimist who has acquired the art of self-deception.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what is a pessimist then?&rsquo; ses Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;a pessimist is one who
has got tired of being an optimist. And now,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;maybe you could tell me what is the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>difference between an Irishman and an
Irish-American?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An Irishman,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;by reason of the
fact that he was born in Ireland and the product of an older
civilization thinks he is a better Irishman than the Irish-American;
and the Irish-American by reason of the fact that he was born an
American and the product of a younger civilization, thinks he is a
better German than an Irish-Irishman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If that is the case,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to commit suicide in Boston, because there
are too many Irish-Americans there. And by all accounts the devil a bit
they know or care about the Irish, no more than the English themselves.
Now let us consider New York. What is the difference between New York
and Boston, I wonder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are more tall hats and silk neckties in New
York,&rsquo; ses Matty. &lsquo;And a native genius could go to his
grave undiscovered there as easily as he could in Boston, while the
patrons of art and men of letters would be feasting and entertaining
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>foreign celebrities who don&rsquo;t give a traneen
about them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a queer world,&rsquo; ses the King.
&lsquo;And sure &rsquo;tis a genius you are yourself, and if I were
you, I wouldn&rsquo;t commit suicide in either place. Personally, I
think Madrid would be as good as any. Howsomever,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;I will ask my Lord High Chancellor and his Court of Learned Men
about the matter, and if they can&rsquo;t decide between now and
to-morrow morning, I will have them all hanged, drawn, and quartered,
and advertise for a more efficient staff of attendants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad, you&rsquo;re a gentleman,&rsquo; ses Matty,
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;m glad to know that you don&rsquo;t show any
leniency to your subordinates, because the instant you do so, they
begin to think they are as good, as bad, or even worse than yourself,
as the case may be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Treat all those above and beneath you with as little
consideration as possible, and you will always be sure of <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e1276" title="Source: respact">respect</span>,&rsquo;
<span class="corr" id="xd20e1279" title="Source: sees">ses</span> the
King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is nothing like being a fool when you have to
deal with foolish people, and to behave <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>sensibly under such
circumstances would only break a man&rsquo;s heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I notice that you are talking hoarse,&rsquo; ses the
King. &lsquo;Is it the way that you have a cold?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a bad cold I have then,&rsquo; ses Matty.
&lsquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid of my life that I may die before I will
commit suicide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That would never do,&rsquo; ses the King. And then and
there he rang for the Queen, and told her to bathe Matty&rsquo;s feet
in a tub of hot water, with plenty of mustard in it. And when the Queen
had finished drying his toes, the King ordered a good glass of rum for
him and ses: &lsquo;Matty of Ballydineen,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;take
this little toothful of sailor&rsquo;s coffee, and bury yourself under
the blankets as quick as you can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you, ever so much,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;but
where am I to sleep?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will sleep with me, of course,&rsquo; ses the
King. &lsquo;&rsquo;Twould never do if anything were to happen to you
at such a critical time in your life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Matty slept with the King of Spain that night, but about
two in the morning the King <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href=
"#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>woke Matty with his snoring. Well,
that was more than Matty could stand, and he lost his temper and gave
the King a poke in the ribs with the heel of his fist, as he ses:
&lsquo;What the blazes do you mean by depriving a decent man of his
sleep like this for?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, was it the way I was snoring again?&rsquo; ses
the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, I thought the last day had come, with the noise
you were making with that trumpet of a nose of yours,&rsquo; ses
Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rsquo; ses the King.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep awake for the remainder of the night lest I
might disturb you again.&rsquo; And then they started talking about old
times and the price of potatoes, ladies&rsquo; hats, and fancy
petticoats. But suddenly the King changed the subject, and ses:
&lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;are the schoolmasters as
ignorant, as conceited, and as pompous as ever?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only worse they are getting,&rsquo; ses
Matty, &lsquo;notwithstanding the cheapness of literature and free
education.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am sorry to hear that,&rsquo; ses the King. And
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>so they discussed everything under the sun from
bird-catching to cock-fighting until morning came. And when they were
called for breakfast, they rushed to the dining-room, and found the
Queen and all the children seated around the table waiting for their
bacon and eggs to be fried. The King, of course, was duly impressed,
and as he sat down, and placed the newspaper in front of the sugar bowl
to get a better view of it, he up and ses to the Queen: &lsquo;Good
morning, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good
word?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord High Chancellor and all his staff could not
decide whether New York or Boston would be the best place for our
worthy and distinguished guest to commit suicide, so they all hanged
themselves during the night to save you the trouble of having it done
to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses the King to Matty, &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t
it a great thing to have men in your employment who can show so much
respect for yourself and such consideration for your
feelings?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis always a great pleasure, to get others to
do what you wouldn&rsquo;t do yourself,&rsquo; ses Matty. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the King turned to the Queen and ses: &lsquo;They were
good faithful servants, but like all of their kind they thought too
little about themselves, and too much about those they tried to serve.
The man who doesn&rsquo;t consider himself first in all things deserves
to be considered last by everybody. Howsomever, they deserved to be
buried anyway, so give orders to have them all cut down and sent home
to their own people. They have the best right to them, now that they
are no more use to any one else. But keep their old clothes and send
them to the Salvation Army. &rsquo;Tis better, indeed, that the poor
should have their overcoats and nightshirts than the moths to eat
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis an ill
wind that blows nobody good, but nevertheless, I am as badly off as
ever, without one to advise me or to tell me what to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;strictly speaking,
when a man doesn&rsquo;t know what to do himself, the devil a much
another can do for him. There is nothing cheaper than advice, and
oftentimes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>nothing dearer, that is, if you are foolish enough
to take it from everybody. Looking for advice is only a form of
diversion with most people, because we all do what we please in the
end. And now, between ourselves,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;once a man makes
up his mind to marry the wrong woman, all the advice in the world
won&rsquo;t save him. And once a man is married, he is no longer his
own property. I have done my best for you,&rsquo; ses the King,
&lsquo;but the world is full of people who can do as little as myself.
Howsomever, I will give you a letter of introduction to my friend the
President of the United States, as you are on your way to America, and
he may be able to help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you very much,&rsquo; ses Matty. &lsquo;I have
already been in America, and I have had as many letters of introduction
as would paper the house for you, but they were no more use to me than
they were to Columbus. No more use, I might say, than a fur-lined coat
and a pair of warm gloves would be to the Devil himself. But I am none
the less grateful for your kindness.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am glad you are able to appreciate kindness,&rsquo;
ses the King. &lsquo;Because very few people know when they are well
treated, or when they are well off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rsquo; ses Matty. &lsquo;But
&rsquo;tis the spirit of discontent that keeps the world moving. The
man who is satisfied with himself usually proves unsatisfactory to
every one else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;when a man has the
gift of being able to please himself, what does it matter, if he
displeases every one else? &rsquo;Tis nice, of course, to have a lot of
friends, but a man&rsquo;s friends very often can cause him more
annoyance than his enemies, and he must endure it to prove his
inconsistency. Whereas in the case of an enemy, you can always lose
your self-respect by abusing him when you are displeased with his
success, and no one will think anything the less of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only by making allowances and excuses for
each other&rsquo;s short-comings and idiosyncracies that we are able to
live at all. And if we could see the good in the worst of us as easily
as we can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>see the bad in the best of us, we might think less
of ourselves and more of those we despise. &rsquo;Tis only by being
better than those who are worse than us that we can respect ourselves,
I&rsquo;m thinking,&rsquo; ses Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;what the devil a man
with as much sense as yourself wants committing suicide for is more
than I can understand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe &rsquo;tis as well,&rsquo; ses Matty. &lsquo;The
less we know about each other, the happier we can be. Nearly every one
of us has some disease of the mind or body that shortens our natural
existence. Some suffer from too much conceit, others from a shaky
heart, or a loose brain caused by a nagging wife, or too much hard work
and not enough to eat, and various other causes, but there is always a
reason for everything, even the unreasonableness of those who have no
reason at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Old talk, like this,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;leads
nowhere, because no matter how much we may know about art, literature,
and music, the very best of us can only be reasonable and sensible when
we have nothing to upset us. A hungry <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>man is always angry, and
an angry man is never sensible. On the other hand, a man will make a
lot of foolish promises and resolutions after a good dinner, and when
he begins to get hungry again he will think that he was a fool for
having entertained such decent sentiments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In a word,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;selfishness is the
normal condition of every one. Some are selfish by being decent, and
others by being mean, but strictly speaking, there is very little
difference between them, because we all please ourselves, no matter
what we do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know we do,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;and
that&rsquo;s why we incur the displeasure of others. But as we are
beginning to get involved and going back to where we started like those
who discuss, but can&rsquo;t understand theology, or like the bird who
flies away in the morning, only to return to its nest at the fall of
night, I think we had better finish, now that we have ended, so to
speak, and bid each other good-by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t
the way that you would let me out of doors a cold day like this,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>without a bit of a topcoat to shelter me from the
cold and wind, and I with a touch of the influenza already?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;I have had enough of
your company, and when we get tired of those who have either
entertained, helped, or distracted us, we usually find a way of getting
rid of them. The greatest mistake in life is to be too kind to any one.
When a woman is getting tired of her husband, everything he does to
please her only causes her annoyance. But nevertheless, if she has any
sense at all, she can&rsquo;t but respect him for wasting his affection
on one not worthy of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But what about the topcoat?&rsquo; ses Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get it,&rsquo; ses the King.
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the loss of a topcoat, even though it might be a
gift itself, compared to getting rid of a troublesome companion?
Besides, a man who has made up his mind to commit suicide must be very
careful of himself, lest a toothache, a bad attack of neuralgia, or the
&lsquo;fluenza might cause him to change his mind. Many a man changed
his mind for less.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So with those few words the King presented Matty with a new
overcoat, and walked with him as far as the garden gate at the end of
the Castle grounds, and then he ses, the same as they always say in
America, &lsquo;Good-by, and call again some time.&rsquo; But he did
not say when.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to be a polite way of telling a person to go to
the devil,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;but we might as well be
polite when we can. And sincerity, unless &rsquo;tis accompanied by
wisdom and discretion, does more harm than good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world has suffered as much from sincere fools as it has
from wise scoundrels,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;But what did Matty do
when he took his leave of the King of Spain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;he set sail for Persia,
and called upon His Majesty the Gaekwar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the dead of night when he arrived at the Royal Palace,
and without the least scruple he roused His Imperial Majesty from his
slumbers. And when he put his head out of the window <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>and
asked who was there, Matty up and ses: &lsquo;Come down-stairs and open
the door and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the Gaekwar came down-stairs in his nightshirt, and when
he opened the door to let Matty in, he ses, as he frothed from the
mouth with the sheer dint of passion: &lsquo;Who, in the name of all
the conger eels that are sold as salmon, are you, to bring a decent man
from his bed at this hour of the night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am one Matty the Goat, my father is dead, my
grandfather was a protestant who never got any meat to eat on Fridays,
and my great-grandfather could jump the height of himself before he was
three sevens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To hell with your father, your grandfather, and all
belonging to you,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t for the
life of me understand why people will bother their friends and
acquaintances by retailing the exploits of their own family every time
they get a chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;we think more of our
own, of course, than they do about us, and if we didn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>praise them, people might think they were no
better than ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Most people aren&rsquo;t worth praising or remembering
anyway,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar. &lsquo;But that is no reason why you
should bring me from my warm bed and have me shaking here like an aspen
leaf, and the very stars themselves shivering with the cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure, &rsquo;tis myself that&rsquo;s colder than any
star, and I, that had to be out in a raging storm, with wind blowing a
hundred miles an hour, and the rain falling and flooding the streets,
and every raindrop would fill your hat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t interest me in the least,&rsquo;
ses the Gaekwar. &lsquo;What I want to know is what brought you
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to know whether &lsquo;twould be better to
commit suicide in New York or Boston,&rsquo; ses Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, ten thousand curses, plus the curse of Cromwell
on you, for a godson of the Devil, for no one else would try to get
another to solve such a problem,&rsquo; ses he. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the way I must have the Devil for a
guardian angel, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;because I
am never out of trouble, God help me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are many like you, I am glad to say,&rsquo; ses
the Gaekwar, &lsquo;and we are always pleased to find others worse off
than ourselves. &rsquo;Tis the only compensation we have for being
either unfortunate or foolish. Howsomever, come in out of the cold, and
we will talk the matter over. But,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;you must
excuse the untidy condition of the house. The painters and plumbers are
working here, and if you know anything at all, you must know what a
mess they can make, especially the plumbers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed, I do,&rsquo; ses Matty. &lsquo;But you
needn&rsquo;t make any apologies. I am a man after your own heart and
just as humble and maybe as foolish, if not more so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nevertheless,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe &lsquo;twould ever occur to me to call on yourself
either at the dead of night or the middle of the broad day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it would,&rsquo; ses Matty.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Howsomever,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;make yourself
comfortable while I&rsquo;ll run up-stairs, and put on my
clothes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Matty drew his chair to the fire, and when the Gaekwar
returned, dressed in his new suit and clean collar, Matty ses:
&lsquo;How is herself and the children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The children are all right, thank God,&rsquo; ses the
Gaekwar, &lsquo;but I am nearly worried to death about
herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rsquo; ses
Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.
She seems to be perfectly happy and contented, and no longer loses her
temper, or finds fault with any body or anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a bad and
a dangerous sign. Why don&rsquo;t you see a doctor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a dozen doctors, but they all say
there is no name for her complaint. &rsquo;Tis some new disease, and
there is no mention of it in the Bible, the modern novel, or the
Cornucopia,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pharmacop&oelig;ia, you mean, I presume,&rsquo; ses
Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, yes. That&rsquo;s what I mean. You must excuse my
ignorance,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;because it isn&rsquo;t necessary for
me to be as enlightened as the ordinary poor man who must work for his
living. All that&rsquo;s expected of one like myself is to be able to
read the sun-dial, lay a few foundation stones once &rsquo;n a while,
review the troops, and eat a lot of good dinners. And now might I ask
how is your wife and family, and what made you take it into your head
to commit suicide?&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;my trouble is just the
reverse of yours. You are upset because your wife is contented and
happy, and I am upset because my wives are discontented and
unhappy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your wives!&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar, with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;I have two
wives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not another word,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar, &lsquo;until
you will have three glasses of the best whiskey. &rsquo;Tis a wonder
that you are above ground at all.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God knows,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;life is a terrible
thing sometimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Life,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar, &lsquo;is what other
people make it for us. But even at that we should try and be content,
more for our own sake than anything else. Fretting and worrying never
made any one look young, and nobody would fret or worry at all if they
only thought enough and worked hard enough. Some, you know, believe
that we lived before, and that this life is the reward for our virtues
in the other world. Indeed, some go so far as to say that this may be
Heaven, while others think it must be&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s so,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
glad I didn&rsquo;t meet some of the bla&rsquo;gards I knew before they
were born, so to speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I imagine,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar, &lsquo;that a man
with as much sense as you appear to have wouldn&rsquo;t buy a house
without first seeing it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; ses Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then what do you want to commit suicide for?
That&rsquo;s just like buying a pig in a bag. You don&rsquo;t know what
you are going to get until <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>after you have made the purchase.
Suicide, for all we know, may be only going from the frying pan into
the fire. In a sense, &rsquo;tis like exchanging some valuable jewel
for a lot of promises. And &rsquo;tis my solid belief that none of us
know how wicked and foolish we are until we will get a peep at the Book
of Records in the world to come. The very thought of that should be
enough to keep a man alive forever. If there were as many worlds as
there are stars, or grains of sands, then I might be able to understand
why a man would want to commit suicide, if he was of a roaming
disposition, and wanted to write a book of his travels and adventures.
But suppose there is only one world, and that world may be this world,
or there may be just another world, and that the next, what then?
Anyway, I am surprised at you, an Irishman, not to be able to stand the
abuse of two wives after all your race has suffered both from friends
and enemies alike for generations. And Ireland&rsquo;s would-be
friends, in many ways, have been her worst enemies. However, be that as
it may, I would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>like to know what you would do if you were like
the Sultan of Sparonica, and he with more wives than you could count in
a month of Sundays. &rsquo;Tis always well to keep what you have until
you are sure of getting something better,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;suicide is often the
fate of a brave man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, Matty,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis
ever the fate of a foolish man. Life at its longest is so short that we
should all be able to endure it, even when our plans do not work out to
our satisfaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But when a man loses interest in everything,
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No man should lose interest in the beautiful things of
life. And who indeed will gainsay that life at its longest is too
short, especially for a man with a grievance like yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Life is too short to understand women,&rsquo; ses
Matty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis easy enough to understand them,&rsquo; ses
the Gaekwar, &lsquo;but &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t easy to understand why we
go to such trouble to please them.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to commit suicide rather than try to
please them any more,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;and if I could discover
whether New York or Boston would be the better place to end my life,
I&rsquo;d be a happy man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You might as well die in either place as to jump from
the Eiffel Tower, Blarney Castle, Shandon Steeple, or try to swim over
Niagara Falls,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis easy to see,&rsquo; ses Matty, &lsquo;that
you can&rsquo;t be of any help or consolation to a man like myself. You
have too much common-sense to pay any attention to a barking dog, so to
speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have, indeed,&rsquo; ses the Gaekwar. &lsquo;You
need never muzzle a dog that barks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So with that he shook hands with Matty and ses:
&lsquo;Good-by, God speed you, long life to you, and may your next
trouble be seven daughters. The more trouble we have the less we think
about it, and a thorn in a man&rsquo;s toe is nothing to a bullet in
his head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that Matty went to the Czar of all the Russians, and
from the Czar to the King of Greece, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>and after he had
spent years traveling the world looking, in vain, for advice as to
whether New York or Boston would be the best place to commit suicide,
he returned home and to his great surprise learnt that his two wives
had married again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened then?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, he found he was worse off than ever. He
could not decide where to commit suicide, and his wives, the cause of
all his trouble and entertainment, would never trouble him again. They
were too busy troubling some one else. And lo and behold! the shock
stretched him on the flat of his back, and when the doctor told him
that he had only a month to live, he turned his face to the wall and
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He expected to die of old age, like all would-be suicides, I
dare say,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;He was just one
of the many people whose trouble is their greatest pleasure, and who
are never happy only when they are annoying others with their own
affairs.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101"

<p class="first"><span class="corr" id="xd20e1501" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Wisha, in the name of all the nonentities
that a man meets at a fancy dress ball, or a lawn tennis party,&rdquo;
said Padna to Micus, as he saw him holding a lantern over a pool of
water, on a dark night, at the crossroads of Carrignamore, &ldquo;what
are you doing, at all, at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for the moon that was here in the pool,
less than an hour ago, and a more beautiful moon was never seen in any
part of the whole world,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;if &rsquo;twas twice as
beautiful, and twice as large, and the size of a Chinese sunshade
inself, you&rsquo;d have no more chance of finding it on a dark night
like this, than you&rsquo;d have of finding a circus at the North Pole,
or discovering why women will worry about their husbands when they stay
out late at night, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>then abuse the devil out of them
when they come in, even though they had to stay out through no fault of
their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say may be true,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;but
&rsquo;tis better a man should have an interest in astronomy or
something else, and go looking for the moon in a pool of water at the
crossroads, than have no interest in anything at all, except killing
time talking about the wars of the world, or the ways of his
neighbours. And sure if a man couldn&rsquo;t find the moon inself, he
might find something else while he&rsquo;d be looking for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedad, and that&rsquo;s true enough too! Many a man found
happiness when he went looking for trouble, and many a man found
trouble when he went looking for happiness, and a man often found a
friend where he expected to find an enemy, and found an enemy where he
expected to find a friend,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a word, we go through life looking for what we can&rsquo;t
find, and finding what we didn&rsquo;t go to look for. Think of poor
Columbus, and what he found, and he not looking for America,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>at all. Sure, that sort of thing would encourage
any one to set out on a voyage of adventure, even though he
mightn&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;d be going to, or what he might be
doing,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking about findings and losings, and strange happenings in
general, I wonder if you ever heard tell of the bishop who took off his
hat to a poor man,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not, then, and I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it
either,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bedad, whether you believe it or no, &rsquo;tis a fact,
then, nevertheless,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it must have been a mistake of some kind, or maybe an
accident. &rsquo;Tis possible, of course, that His Lordship took off
his hat to leave the air to his head when the poor man was passing, but
I can&rsquo;t imagine that he removed it for any other purpose, unless,
maybe, a wasp, or a fly settled on his bald crown. In that case he
would take off his hat to scratch his head,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe what I&rsquo;m telling you,
there&rsquo;s no use going on with the story,&rdquo; said Padna.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not then. But surely,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;you
must have something else to relate, and I not to lay eyes on you since
Monday was a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have another story, if you&rsquo;d like to hear it,&rdquo;
said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;d like to hear it. What is it all
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all about a pig and a clucking hen,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take the shortest cut home, and I&rsquo;ll listen to
the story as we walk along. And &rsquo;tis glad I am that I went
looking for the moon, this blessed night, else I mightn&rsquo;t have
found yourself, and I dying to have a talk with some one,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, as he sauntered leisurely along with
his friend Micus, who kept swinging a lantern, &ldquo;on my way home
from market yesterday evening, as the sun was sinking behind the hills,
I strolled along the road that leads to Five Mile Bridge, and I felt so
tired after the journey from Cork to Ballinabearna that I was compelled
to say to myself: &lsquo;Padna,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;why the devil
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>don&rsquo;t you be sensible once in a while, and
take a rest for yourself when you feel tired? What&rsquo;s the use in
wearing yourself out, and causing yourself unnecessary pain and
torture, when in a few short years you will be as dead as decency, or
disinterested kindness, which is no less than one and the same thing.
And once you are dead, you are dead for ever and ever, and no one will
bother their heads about you, or care whether you lived or not, or just
existed, by trying to please every one but yourself. The man who tries
to please everybody,&rsquo; ses I to myself, &lsquo;won&rsquo;t live
half as long as one of the aristocracy, who don&rsquo;t care where the
money comes from so long as he has it to spend.&rsquo; And when all
that was said, I then up and ses: &lsquo;Padna,&rsquo; ses I,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s good sound advice, and don&rsquo;t forget what I
have told you.&rsquo; And then and there I made one jump and landed on
top of a ditch, and as I looked over my shoulder into the field behind,
what did I see but a pig and a clucking hen, and they exchanging
salutations. And then they began to talk and this is what I heard:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good evening,&rsquo; ses the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good evening kindly and good luck. How are you feeling
to-day?&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just about the same as ever,&rsquo; ses the pig.
&lsquo;Sure, &rsquo;tis a sad world for us all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis, God help us!&rsquo; ses the hen.
&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t start me crying again, this sorrowful day, for
&rsquo;tis myself who has shed a bucketful of tears, since my poor
grandmother was choked this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be crying about that, if I were
you,&rsquo; ses the pig. &lsquo;Sure, &rsquo;tis as good to be choked
as to have your head cut off with a rusty knife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t about that in particular that I
have fumed and worried, and wept so copiously,&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And about what then?&rsquo; ses the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;About everything in general. The ingratitude of man,
the presumption and assumption of women, and the consumption of ham and
eggs,&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, wisha, God knows,&rsquo; ses the pig, &lsquo;you
couldn&rsquo;t waste your tears over a more worthy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>and
likewise unworthy object. And like the pessimist that I am, myself,
&rsquo;tis but little respect that I have for man or woman either. Only
for the fact that I have still some pride left, and wouldn&rsquo;t like
to disgrace my own family, I&rsquo;d end my miserable existence by
committing suicide, and drown myself in the horse pond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you were to do the likes of that, you would sin
against tradition, and only be sold as sausages. Whereas, if you were
to die a natural death by strangulation, amputation of the head, or
bisection of the windpipe, you would be sent to the best
butcher&rsquo;s shop in the town, and the different parts of your
anatomy would be sold at the very highest rates, the same as all your
family, relations and ancestors,&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention my family or my ancestors to me.
They were all snobs, each and every one of them,&mdash;father, mother,
sisters, and brothers. &rsquo;Twas little respect they ever had for
myself, and always said that I was only fit to be used for sausages,
anyway. As though, indeed, I didn&rsquo;t come of as good a stock as
the best of them.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I often heard that you came of very respectable
people,&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Respectable isn&rsquo;t the name for them belonging to
me. There were gentry, and no less, in our family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that so?&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, indeed, it is,&rsquo; ses the pig.
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas a piece of my
great-great-great-great-grandfather&rsquo;s great-grandfather that gave
Napoleon indigestion before Waterloo. And that&rsquo;s how he lost the
day by giving wrong orders to his generals,&rsquo; ses the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And &rsquo;twas from eating a bad egg,&rsquo; ses the
hen, &lsquo;that King George got the hiccoughs, and fell from his horse
while reviewing his troops in France. And that&rsquo;s how he won the
Victoria Cross and got a rise of two and tuppence a week in his wages.
Howsomever, be that as it may, &rsquo;tis a pension yourself should
have from the German and English Governments, instead of earning your
living by eating yourself to death, so to speak. An aristocrat of your
social standing should be living on some one else&rsquo;s money, and
your time should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"
name="pb109">109</a>]</span>be divided between sleeping and eating,
like all the other members of the fraternity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the pig, &lsquo;my associates and
equals wouldn&rsquo;t think of recognising me, unless I was fully
dressed for dinner at some fashionable hotel or restaurant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fully dressed!&rsquo; ses the hen. &lsquo;With bread
crumbs on your hind quarters, you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses the hen, &lsquo;I come of good stock
myself. The members of my family always supplied eggs to the King of
Spain, the Mayor of Boston, and the Royalty of England and
America.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha,&rsquo; ses the pig, &lsquo;what are a few eggs,
even when they are fresh inself, compared to a fine ham, two pork
chops, a soft crubeen, or a flitch of bacon, boiled down with plenty of
cabbage, and set before a battalion of hungry policemen on a cold
winter&rsquo;s day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the hen, &lsquo;no one would think of
eating bacon and cabbage all the time, while eggs are always in season.
But &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t quarreling about such a trifle that we should
be, when we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>have no great grievance against ourselves, but
against mankind in general.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The inconsistency of mankind is disgusting, to say the
very least of it,&rsquo; ses the pig. &lsquo;Every one from the king to
the beggar has a bad word to say for the pig. We stand for all
that&rsquo;s contemptible, loathsome and vile, and yet the most
delicate and refined people will always call for ham and eggs, in the
morning, in preference to anything else. And if one of those genteel
young men who might have had my poor grandmother&rsquo;s liver for
supper, was to meet myself on the road, and he with a young lady by his
side, and she as fond of ham and eggs as himself, neither of them would
bid me the time of day, or ask how I might be, or say as much as go to
Belgium, or anything at all, but make disparaging remarks about my
idiosyncracies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And think of myself,&rsquo; ses the hen. &lsquo;I that
have laid more eggs than you could count in a lifetime, and I have
reared five large families, besides. And the day I can&rsquo;t lay any
more, I&rsquo;ll be killed by some caubogue of a churn boy,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>and sold to some landlady who boards tramps,
navvies, and all kinds of traveling tinkers. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind
inself if I went to nourish and sustain some decent people, who could
appreciate the tender parts of my constitution. Or if I could be like
my poor father, who was killed with a new razor, stuffed with bread and
currants, roasted on a spit, and exhibited in a shop window before
Christmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! we live in a thoughtless and heartless
world!&rsquo; ses the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; ses the hen. &lsquo;Only about one
in every ten thousand has either the power or the privilege of thinking
for themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Everything seems to go by contrary. Take the decent
people,&mdash;the Jews, for instance. They have no respect for the
members of my family, but they are consistent. They wouldn&rsquo;t
write their name, or my epitaph, on my back with a hot poker, and make
fun of my table manners, and then go home and have pork for dinner and
say &rsquo;twas worth walking to America for,&rsquo; ses the pig.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nevertheless,&rsquo; ses the hen, &lsquo;when I think
of what yourself and myself does for mankind, and the poor return we
get, I feel proud to know that we can be of service to those who
don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t appreciate us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, indeed, and so do I,&rsquo; ses the pig.
&lsquo;What would life be to most people without their ham and eggs
every morning, and the newspaper thrown in. And a cigar never tastes
sweeter than after a good feed of spare ribs and yellow
turnips.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or even sausages,&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I object to sausages and salt meat in general, because
it makes people cranky and disputatious,&rsquo; ses the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; ses the hen, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no
doubt but we do a lot of good, though we have been neglected. And it
makes my heart bleed, when I think of the stupidity of man and his
perverted sense of honour. After all those years of preaching and
reform, no poet has ever written an ode to a hen or a pig, and all the
poets liked their ham and eggs. There was Shakespeare
himself,&mdash;people thought he forgot nothing, or what he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>forgot wasn&rsquo;t worth remembering, but
where&rsquo;s the mention of either hens or pigs in all his highly
respected works?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no wonder there is war in the world to-day,&rsquo;
ses the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed it is not, when married men will spend all
their money on finery for their wives, so that they can look better
than they really are, and elope with other women&rsquo;s husbands.
Sure, only for the motherly instinct that&rsquo;s in myself, I would
leave my family of ducklings and die by my own hand, but I don&rsquo;t
want one of them to be neglected and feel the pangs of adversity, like
yourself and myself,&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis instinct rather than reason that guides
most people. If we were always to act reasonably, people would think we
had no sense, at all. However, there&rsquo;s a compensation in all
things, and we can enjoy ourselves in our own old way. And while it is
a great consolation to know that we can do a lot of good, it is a
greater consolation still to know that we can do a lot of harm as
well,&rsquo; ses the pig. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Like myself, you share the same sentiments as all good
and pious people. The satisfaction of doing harm is the only enjoyment
some of us receive for doing good, when our kindness is not
appreciated,&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I think of all those who suffer from dyspepsia
after eating my friends and relations, I ses to myself: &ldquo;Well,
things could be worse even for such as my humble self. You
mightn&rsquo;t have the satisfaction of knowing that there was such a
thing as indigestion.&rdquo; And when I think of what people must pay
for pork chops, in a restaurant after the theatre at night, and how
they must suffer from cramps, pains in the stomach, and a bursting
headache next morning, well then I feel as happy as a wife when she is
abusing her fool of a husband for giving her too much of her own
way,&rsquo; ses the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And when I consider the little nourishment there is in
cold storage eggs, and the price the poor lodgers must pay their
landladies for them, I feel like dancing a jig on a milestone. And
whenever I hear of some one eating a bad egg, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>disguised by frying it hard in margarine, and
seasoning it with salt and pepper, I takes a holiday for myself.
Ptomaine poisoning is as good as cramps, or pains in the head, at any
time,&rsquo; ses the hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course, when we are really hungry, we don&rsquo;t
care what we eat. I have eaten pieces of my relatives and friends dozen
of times, when they were mixed with my food, but to tell the truth it
never gave me any trouble. And in many respects I am no better and no
worse than those who don&rsquo;t care how they make their living, so
long as they have what they want,&rsquo; ses the pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then two farmers came on the scene, and one ses to the
other, as he pointed to the pig with a stick: &lsquo;How much do you
want for the beast?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As much as he will fetch,&rsquo; ses the owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One would think &rsquo;twas a work of art you were
trying to dispose of,&rsquo; ses the man with the stick.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the market price and not a ha&rsquo;penny
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; ses the owner, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
satisfied.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what do you want for that old hen?&rsquo; ses the
man with the stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the owner, &lsquo;she is no more use to
me, and for that reason I must charge you ten or a hundred times her
legitimate value. She is an antique. You can have her for ten
shillings, and be under a compliment to me for my decency,
besides.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll owe you the money,&rsquo; ses the man with
the stick, &lsquo;so that you won&rsquo;t forget your
generosity.&rsquo; And with that they walked away, and I jumped off the
ditch and turned home,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a queer world,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A queer world, surely!&rdquo; said Micus. <span class=

<p class="first"><span class="corr" id="xd20e1668" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Come in, come in, and make yourself at
home; for the flowers of spring couldn&rsquo;t be more heartily
welcome,&rdquo; said Micus Pat to his friend Padna Dan, as he held the
latch of his cottage door. And when Padna crossed the threshold, Micus
turned from his place by the hearth and said: &ldquo;Close the door,
take off your topcoat, and pull the blinds, while I will heap logs and
faggots on the fire, for &rsquo;tis five feet of snow there may be on
the ground before morning, I&rsquo;m thinking. And who knows but the
house itself may be covered up, and we may not be able to move from
where we are for days and days, or a week inself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True for you,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;We never know what
good luck or bad luck the morrow may <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>have for any of us.
Howsomever, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t grumbling we should be about anything,
but take things as they come. The storm rages furiously without, and
to-night, for all the wisest of us can tell, may be the very last night
of the world. The end must come some time, and when the sun rises on
the morrow, this earth of ours, with all its beauty and all its
mystery, and all its splendour, may be reduced to particles of dust,
that will find its way into the eyes of those who dwell on other
spheres. If the gale continues, the world will be swirled from its
course, and &lsquo;twill surely strike some weighty satellite of the
sun or moon with a mighty crash, and that will be the end of all joy
and sorrow. Then the king will be no more than the beggar, and the
beggar will be as much as the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will place the kettle on the hob,&rdquo; said Micus,
&ldquo;for &rsquo;tis true courage we will want to put into our hearts
with a good drop of poteen this blessed night. And a drop of poteen is
a wonderful thing to drive away the melancholy thoughts that haunt and
bother so many of us. We can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href=
"#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>fill glass after glass of steaming
punch, until the jar in the cupboard is empty. For what is life to some
but so many glasses of poteen, the best whiskey or brandy, or wine all
the ways from France itself, and so many meals of food, a few good
books to read, and maybe a congenial friend or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is a rugged and a lonely road, but flowers always grow
on the wayside,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you try to pluck a flower, &rsquo;tis a thorn you
will find in your hand, maybe,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so, indeed. But let us forget the pitfalls that await
us at every turn, and while the wind blows let us fill our pipes and
fill our glasses, and sing a merry song if we should feel like doing
so, for there is no use looking for the Devil to bid him good-morrow
until we will meet him. And the best thing to do when he appears in
person, or in disguise, is to pass him by the same as if he was no
relation of yours at all,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>And then Micus heaped dried faggots and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>logs
on the glowing hearth, and as they crackled and blazed, red sparks flew
up the chimney, and the shutters of the windows, and the latch of the
door, and the loose tiles on the ridge, and the loose slates on the
gable, shook and rattled, and trees were uprooted, and slates were
blown from the roofs of houses and so was the golden thatch, and havoc
was wrought in the city, the town, and the hamlet, on the mountain
side, in the valley, and by the seashore. And as Micus and Padna
settled themselves comfortably in two armchairs, the white dog and the
black cat drew closer to their feet, while a thrush in his large white
cage made of twigs, and a linnet in his small green cage made of wires
and beechwood, closed their eyes and buried their heads beneath their
wings.</p>
<p>Flash after flash of lightning lit up the darkened countryside, and
each peal of thunder was louder than its predecessor, and at times one
thought that the whole artillery of hell with the Devil in command had
opened fire, and that the fury of the elements would send all to
perdition. But Padna and Micus looked on unperturbed at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>the
crackling faggots. And as the first glass of warm punch was raised on
high, Micus up and said: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s good luck to us all, the
generous as well as the covetous, for &rsquo;tis little any of us know
why we are what we are, or why we do the things we do, and don&rsquo;t
want to do. And as we can&rsquo;t always be decent, we might at least
be charitable when we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But alas! alas! we seldom think before we act, and usually
act without thinking, and that&rsquo;s why there are so many strange
doings and happenings,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;Be all that as it may,
neglect not your duty as my host to-night, and take charge of the
decanter, and keep my glass well filled with punch, and my pipe well
filled with tobacco, and I will tell you a story that may set your
heart beating against your ribs, and your knees knocking together, and
your hands may shake till the tumbler will fall from your fingers, and
your teeth may rattle until the pipe will fall from your
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it to me, for I&rsquo;m filled with curiosity to hear a
strange tale. And maybe &rsquo;tis a story <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>about some beautiful woman, or the Aurora
Borealis, or some monster of the deep,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t either one or the other, but the story of a
horse,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A horse, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, the White Horse of Banba,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came you to hear it?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an old man of dignified bearing, tall and stately he
was, with a long flowing beard, clear grey-blue eyes, nicely chiseled
features, keen wit, and a soft easy tongue, who told me the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did you meet him?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the high road overlooking the Glen of the Leprechauns, on
a starlit night before the moon came up,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On with the story,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, as he lit his pipe, &ldquo;three
weeks ago, come Tuesday, I was strolling along the road for myself by
the Bridge of the Seven Witches, thinking of nothing but the future of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>the children, when I heard strange footsteps
behind me, and on looking over my shoulder, I espied a man I had never
seen before. And as our eyes met, he up and ses: &lsquo;Good night,
stranger,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;Good night kindly,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a fine night,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A glorious night, thank God,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed it is that,<span class="corr" id="xd20e1729"
title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> ses he. &lsquo;And a night to be
appreciated and enjoyed by ghosts, fairies, goblins and hobgoblins,
gnomes and elves, owls and barroway-bats, and all the strange creatures
of the earth, that does be scared to venture out in the broad daylight,
as well as man himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt whatever about what you
say,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;And a fine night for any one who likes to
walk to the top of a mountain to see the moon rising, the stars
twinkling, or for those who like to hear the soft wind blowing through
the tall rushes in the bogs, and making music, the like of which would
inspire a poet to write verses and have them printed in a book, for
women to read and talk about, and hold disputatious arguments on modern
poetry,&rsquo; ses I. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And so we walked and talked until we came to the great Cliff
of Banba, that overlooks the ocean on the southwest coast. And as we
sat down to rest our weary limbs, he looked from the sky to a high
pinnacle of rock, and ses: &lsquo;A beautiful sight is the Cliff of
Banba when viewed from the ocean beyond, in a small boat, a sloop, or a
four-masted ship. But the most beautiful of all sights is to see the
White Horse of Banba himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never heard tell of him,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, you must be a queer man, not to have heard tell
of the White Horse of Banba. Now,&rsquo; ses he, as he crossed his
legs, and put his hand under his jaw, &lsquo;fill your pipe,&rsquo; ses
he, &lsquo;and smoke, and smoke, and smoke until you will drive cold
fear from your heart. For the story I am going to tell you this blessed
night may turn every hair on your head as white as the drifting snow,
and every tooth in your head may chatter, and rattle and fall out on
the ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;&rsquo;twould take more than
the mere telling of a story, no matter how long or how short, or a
hundred stories about the living or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>the dead to scare or
frighten or disturb me in any way, and I a married man for more years
than you could count on your own fingers and toes, and herself as
stubborn and as contrary as the first day she made up her mind to marry
me. So &rsquo;tis thinking I am that I will be neither white, nor grey,
nor sallow, nor toothless, nor bald maybe, after I have heard the story
of the White Horse of Banba; or the Black Horse of Carrigmore, and he
that took Shauneen the Cobbler away on his back on a dark and windy
night and drowned him in the Lough at Cork, because he was cursed by
the widow Maloney for spoiling the heel of her shoe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God forgive her for putting a curse on any poor
man,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Amen,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;if you think that you will
be neither white, nor grey, nor one way nor another but the way you are
at this present moment, I wouldn&rsquo;t be boasting, if I were you,
until the story is told. Because once it strikes your ears, you can
never keep it out of your mind, whether <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>you be sailing over
the seas in a full-rigged clipper, or walking the lonely roads at home,
or in foreign parts. &lsquo;Twill be with you when you wake up in the
morning, and when you are going to bed at night, and even when you are
asleep and dreaming inself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If &rsquo;tis such a wonderful and astonishing story
as all that, why don&rsquo;t you write it down, and have it printed in
a book?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some of the best stories were never written,&rsquo;
ses he. &lsquo;And some of the wisest sayings are forgotten and the
foolish ones remembered. But once the story of the White Horse of Banba
is told, &lsquo;twill keep ringing in your ears till the dawn of your
doom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Really?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the White Horse
of Banba who comes in the dark of the night to carry us all from the
Prison of Life to the Land of the Mighty Dead. And &rsquo;twas he stole
the woman of my heart from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;maybe &rsquo;tis better
that he should have stolen her than some worthless bla&rsquo;guard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>who couldn&rsquo;t appreciate and treat her
decently. There are more married than keep good house,&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true, but &rsquo;tis no comfort for a man
to see the woman he loves the wife of another, unless she might have
the devil of a temper, and no taste for anything but gallivanting
through the streets,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;And only for the White Horse
of Banba, I might be the father of a fine large family, who would be
able to earn enough to keep me idle in my old age. Then I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to be worrying and fretting, when I am walking
behind a plough or a harrow, on a warm day, or searching the boreens,
the long winding lanes, or the dusty roads, looking for a lost sheep or
a wandering cow, and watering the green grass that grows under my feet
with the sweat that does be falling from my brow. Not, indeed, that I
couldn&rsquo;t have more wives than I&rsquo;d want. But &rsquo;tis too
respectable a man I am to ever fall in love with more than one woman.
And that&rsquo;s something that very few can boast of, whether they be
single or married, inself.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128"
href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who told you about the White Horse of
Banba?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have seen him with my own two eyes,&rsquo; ses
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In this very spot. And I have seen him in every nook
and corner of the land from the Giants&rsquo; Causeway to the Old Head
of Kinsale, and as many times as you forgot to keep your promises too,
and he with the golden shoes and hoofs of ivory, and a long mane that
reaches down to the ground and a neck more beautiful than a swan, and
eyes that sparkle like glow-worms when night is as dark as
pitch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And he will carry us all to the Land of the Mighty
Dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, he will carry each and every one of us to the
great country beyond the grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis strange indeed,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;that
you should see the White Horse of Banba so often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some are more favoured than others,&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;But if you will wait until the lights in the city grow dim, and
when the lights in the sky <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href=
"#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>sparkle and glimmer, and when the
birds fall asleep on their perches, and the dogs begin to snore in
their kennels, and all the tired people are stretched in their beds,
then if you are lucky you may see him passing by here, and he flying
through the night, the way you&rsquo;d see a pigeon racing home, or a
meteor shooting through space.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And is it all alone that he does be?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No. There is always some one on his back, and the
banshee follows at his heels, wailing and moaning the way you&rsquo;d
be scared out of your wits.<span class="corr" id="xd20e1792" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But some people have no wits,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s so. But we all dread something. It may be
the sea, fire, loneliness, the past, the present, the future,
hereafter, a wife with an angel&rsquo;s face and the tongue of the
Devil, a rat maybe, or a shadow itself. There&rsquo;s a weak spot in
the strongest, and a strong spot in the weakest, even though it might
be stubbornness. But there&rsquo;s nothing to make a man more scared
than the cry of the banshee that follows the White <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>Horse of Banba as he gallops along the dreary
roads, where the ghosts themselves would be afraid to venture. And he
always has some one on his back, holding on to his wavy mane, lest they
might fall and be dashed to pieces on the cobbled roadway. Sometimes it
does be an old man full of days with toothless gums and white hair that
you&rsquo;d see, and other times some comely maiden, with the virtue of
purity and innocence stamped on her brow, and she more beautiful than
Helen of Troy or the Queen of Sheba. And oftentimes it does be a little
child with rosy cheeks and golden curls, or maybe an infant who just
opened its eyes to get one peep at the world, and then closed them
forever. It may be a young giant of a man that you&rsquo;d see, or an
old woman, wrinkled and feeble. And as he skelters by, the very trees
themselves bow their heads, the corncrakes in the meadows and the toads
in the marshes keep still, and you would hear no sound at all, except
the clattering of hoofs on the stony roads and the wailing of the
banshee. &rsquo;Tis along this very road that the White Horse
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>comes at the close of night and the birth of
morn, and he races with the speed of the lightning flash, until he
comes to the top of the cliff beyond, where he stands for a little
while, sniffs the air and shakes his mane, turns his head and gives a
knowing look at whoever does be on his back. Then a weird whinnying cry
is heard, and he plunges into the sea, and he swims and swims through
the surf and billows until he reaches the edge of the moon that does be
rising out of the waters at the horizon. As quick as thought he shakes
the water from his mane, stamps and prances and jumps from the top of
the moon to the nearest star, and from star to star until he arrives at
the Golden Gate of the Land of No Returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then he walks through a beautiful avenue, sheltered by
tall green trees and made fragrant with sweet blooms, until he is met
by St. Peter and St. Patrick on the steps of a marble palace. And the
stranger on his back dismounts and accompanies the Holy Apostles into
the Sanctum Sanctorum where a record of our good and bad <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>deeds is kept. And when the record book is found
and the stranger&rsquo;s fate discovered, St. Peter looks at St.
Patrick, and St. Patrick looks at St. Peter, but no words at all are
spoken. Then the stranger is hurried away by an attendant with a
flaming sword in his hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And where does the angel with the flaming sword carry
the poor stranger?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nobody knows,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;And the pity of it
all is that very few care. It was the White Horse of Banba <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e1811" title="Not in source">who</span> took my father
away and my grandfather, and his father and grandfather, and his father
before him again, and some night when we may least expect it he will
take ourselves, and gallop along like the wind over the highways and
byways, through the meadows and marshes, underneath bridges, and over
the cobbled tracts on the mountain side. And a terrifying sight it is
to see him as he thunders past. He spares no one at all, and takes
those we love and those we hate. He stole the woman of my heart from
me, and made me the lonely man that I am to-night.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But isn&rsquo;t it a foolish thing for you to remain a
bachelor, and the world full of beautiful women waiting to be loved by
some one?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A man only loves once,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and when
the woman of your heart is dead who would want to be living at
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And now that the woman of your heart is dead, why
don&rsquo;t you try and forget her when you may never see her
again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course I will see her again. Life is but the shadow
of eternity, and before to-morrow&rsquo;s sun will flood the East with
dazzling light, I will see the woman of my heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where will you see her?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In a land farther away than the farthest
star.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who will carry you there?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The White Horse of Banba,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he may not pass this way to-night,&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As sure as you will make some mistake to-morrow he
will pass this way to-night,&rsquo; ses he. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We know lots of things that we have never been
told,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;And you will be wiser to-morrow than you
are to-day. The hands of the clock are now together at the midnight
hour, and I can hear the clattering of hoofs in the
distance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe the White Horse of Banba is coming,&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and there is no one on
his back this time, for he is looking for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as true as I&rsquo;m telling you, a fiery steed rushed
over the hill, and the stranger jumped on his back, and ses,
&lsquo;Good-by,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;till we meet again in the Valley
of the Dead on the Judgment Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the White Horse of Banba scampered along the rugged
pathway with the wailing banshee at his heels, until the top of the
cliff was reached, and before I could realize what had happened, he
plunged into the dark waters,&rsquo; said Padna.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I hope it will be many a long day before either
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=

door,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so too,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder is the decanter empty,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Padna. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Come in and sit down by the fire, and
don&rsquo;t stand shivering there at the door,&rdquo; said Padna Dan to
his neighbor, Micus Pat. &ldquo;One would think you were afraid to be
natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only afraid of myself and my own
foolishness,&rdquo; answered Micus. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll go in and sit
down. On a cold night, there&rsquo;s nothing like a good fire, a pipe
of tobacco, a cheerful companion, and a faithful dog to lie at your
feet. &rsquo;Tis better than being married a hundred times. Marriage
should be the last thought in any sensible man&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married men,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;are very tiresome
people. They are ever either boasting about their wives and children or
else abusing them. And married women are always worse than their
husbands. A woman becomes a tyrant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137"
href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>when she knows her husband is
afraid of her, and a good wife when she is afraid of him, and when both
are afraid of each other the children are afraid of neither. And
children that aren&rsquo;t afraid of their parents get married young
and always to the wrong people. But as people who want to get married
will get married, then let them get married and enjoy themselves if
they like trouble. I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep out of trouble all my
lifetime, and no one has ever failed so successfully,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way to keep out of trouble,&rdquo;
said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what way is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, by either drowning, hanging, or poisoning
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather fall from an aeroplane, or die a respectable
death and have my name in the papers, than do anything so common as
drowning or hanging myself, if I was trying to escape from marrying a
widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisha, when all is said and done, the longest life is so
short that &rsquo;tis only a fool, or maybe a very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>wise
man, that would make it any shorter. When we fall out of the cradle, we
almost fall into the grave, so to speak, and unless we are either very
bad or very good, we&rsquo;re forgotten before the grass commences to
sprout above us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A graveyard is a great place surely, for grass to grow and
flowers to bloom, and for ghosts to take the fresh air for themselves,
but the last place to go for a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the only place for a poor man. Because there&rsquo;s no
rest in life, except for the very stupid people and the
philosophers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the difference between a stupid man and a
philosopher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stupid man is naturally easy in his mind because of his
wonderful gift from providence, and the philosopher pretends that you
are a wise man, when you know that you are only one of the many poor
fools sent astray in this world, without the least notion where your
wandering footsteps may lead you to, or your preaching lead
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it philosophy that keeps the world
together?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;tis not philosophy, but pride, and pride that
pulls it asunder, and pride that makes hell and heaven. Pride is the
net that the Devil goes fishing with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world must be full of fools then, because I can&rsquo;t
understand myself or any one else, and I never met any one who could
understand me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a man could understand himself, he&rsquo;d die of wisdom,
and if he could understand his friend, he&rsquo;d become his
enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would happen if a man could understand his
enemy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, he&rsquo;d be so wise that he&rsquo;d never get
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and forget the women for a while, and talk a
little about the other wonders of the world. There&rsquo;s nothing more
extraordinary than the patience of married men. The world is full of
wonders, police, clergy, and public houses. But what I do be wondering
most about at the close of day is, how did all the stars get into the
sky?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, to be sure! There&rsquo;s ignorance for you!
Didn&rsquo;t you ever hear tell of the night of the big
wind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the night the earth was blown about in the heavens
the way you&rsquo;d see a piece of paper in the month of March. She was
carried from one place to another, until, lo and behold! she struck the
moon a wallop and shattered her highest mountains into smithereens, and
all the pieces that fell into the sky were turned into the stars you
see floating about on frosty nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did she strike the sun at all in her travels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could the earth strike the sun, you omadhaun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be as easy to strike the sun as the moon, but how
she could strike either is more than any one will ever be able to
understand, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my word, but you&rsquo;re the most ignorant man
one could meet in a year of Saturdays. Don&rsquo;t you know that the
sun is a round hole in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href=
"#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>the floor of Heaven through which
all the fairies and politicians fell the night of the
rebellion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was there a rebellion in Heaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisha, what kind of a man are you not to know all these
things? Sure, there&rsquo;s rebellions everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a rebellion do you refer to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are only two kinds, though there&rsquo;s no
difference between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebellions with a reason and rebellions without a
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should there be rebellions at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, because when people get tired of being good they become
bad, and when they get tired of being bad they become good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll never be in a rebellion,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebellions are the salt of life,&rdquo; said Padna.
&ldquo;Only for the rebellion in Heaven, we wouldn&rsquo;t be here
to-day enjoying ourselves at the expense of our neighbors. Don&rsquo;t
you know that we are to take the place of the fallen angels and that we
must win the respect of St. Peter and St. Patrick <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>by
our courageous behavior? I&rsquo;m never happy only when I&rsquo;m in
the thick of battle, and the only music that charms me is the
thunderous cannonading of the enemy. That&rsquo;s the time that I have
the courage of a lion, the grace and power of an elephant, and the fire
of hell withal in my eye, ready to conquer or die for my convictions.
The man who can&rsquo;t feel and act like a hero should&mdash;What
noise is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only your wife scolding some one outside the door,&rdquo;
answered Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis her voice, surely. Then be off with yourself by
the back door, for &rsquo;tis ten by the clock, and mind the dog in the
haggard while I&rsquo;ll put out the light and go to bed,&rdquo; said
Padna. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Kings and Commoners</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, as he rested his
elbows on the parapet of Blackrock Castle, and watched the river Lee
winding its way towards the ocean, &ldquo;when I look upon a scene so
charming as this, with its matchless beauty, I feel that I am not
myself at all, but some medi&aelig;val king or other, surveying my
dominions, and waiting for the sound of the hunter&rsquo;s horn to wake
me from my revery. If at the present moment, an army of chivalrous
archers, with white plumes in their green hats and bows and arrows
slung on their shoulders and Robin Hood himself at their head, were to
march from out the woods at Glountawn, I wouldn&rsquo;t utter the least
note of surprise or exclamation. No, Micus, not a single word would I
say, even though they might lay a herd of slaughtered deer at my feet,
and pin a falcon&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>wing on my breast; so much do I
feel a part of the good old days when there was no duty on tobacco and
whiskey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;I too feel that I own
the whole countryside, and in a sense I do. Because I can get as much
pleasure from looking at it, and admiring all its dazzling splendour,
as if I had the trouble of keeping it in order and paying rates and
taxes. And after all, what does any of us want but the world to look
at, enough to eat and drink, and a little diversion when we feel like
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man with imagination and insight,&rdquo; said Padna,
&ldquo;need never want for entertainment, because he can always
appreciate and enjoy the folly of others, without having to pay for it.
But be that as it may, &rsquo;tis more satisfying still to have a love
of nature and all that&rsquo;s beautiful, and a healthy distaste for
all that&rsquo;s coarse and ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is made up of all kinds of people, who want to
enjoy themselves in some way or other,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;and
the spirit of destruction is the Devil&rsquo;s contribution to human
happiness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>Why, man alive, you could drown the whole German
Army, and the Kaiser and all his henchmen, in the depths of beautiful
Lough Mahon that stretches before us, and the French wouldn&rsquo;t
feel the least sorry. And you could drown the whole French Army and
General Joffre, and the Germans wouldn&rsquo;t feel sorry. And you
could drown Sir Blunderbluff Carson, and John Redmond wouldn&rsquo;t
feel sorry, and you could drown the Russian, French, English and German
armies, and the socialists wouldn&rsquo;t be sorry, and you could drown
all the socialists and the Salvation Army, and the Devil wouldn&rsquo;t
be sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;&rsquo;twould be a
pity to wound the dignity of the Kaiser by drowning him in a
comparatively small and shallow place like Lough Mahon when he could be
drowned just as comfortably and easily in the middle of the Atlantic or
Pacific Ocean,&mdash;or the Dardanelles, for that matter. And as for
all the trouble &lsquo;twould give the Russians, you could tie him by
the heels to a clothesline in your back yard, the way they tied the
tails of the Kilkenny cats, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146"
href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>dip his head in a bucket of
goat&rsquo;s milk mixed with gunpowder, and let him drown that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s good and bad in the worst of us,&rdquo; said
Micus, &ldquo;and I am sure the Allies would be sorry to have him
drowned at all, when he could be given, for his own private use and
benefit, a superabundance of everlasting peace tokens, such as they
give the poor devils in the trenches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free samples of poisonous gas, you mean, I presume,&rdquo;
said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;However, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t
for the likes of us to be discussing the ways of mighty monarchs when
we are only poor men ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard work,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;never killed the
gentry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;nor decency either, and if they
were to eat twice as much, &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t make them any
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you come to think about it,&rdquo; said Padna,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis the hell of a thing why a man should have to work for
himself, or have to work at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is, and I always lose my temper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>when
I think of the poor men and women, too, who must get up when it is only
time to be going to bed, and work until they fall on the floor from
sheer exhaustion and no one to care or bother about them. Sure, there
must be something wrong, if that sort of thing is right, and the gentry
should be ashamed of themselves for making such conditions possible and
they doing nothing but spending money that they never earned, and
making laws for the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis disgusting,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;to think
that we should have to work for any one, even though they might be the
Prince of Wales, or the Duke of the North Pole himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see for the life of me,&rdquo; said Padna,
&ldquo;why we couldn&rsquo;t make our living as easy as the birds of
the air, the fish of the sea, the insects of the field, or the
policemen. Sure, when you come to think of it, a king is no more than
any other man, only for all the fuss that does be made about him. And I
don&rsquo;t see why one man should be thought better than another when
he isn&rsquo;t. Only for the fine clothes that some of us wear,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>no one would take the least notice of us, and if
you were to put a dead king and a dead duke, and yourself and myself
beside each other, Micus, on the top of the Galtee Mountains, and
exposed our carcasses to the rains and the snow, not to mention the
southwesterly gales, for three months, when the experts would come
along to identify us, &rsquo;tis the way they would think that you were
the duke and I was the king, and the duke was no one but yourself, and
who could the king be but myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe &rsquo;tis the way that they would think that you
were only the duke, and that myself was the king,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true, of course, that a king is no more than one
of ourselves when he is dead, but there is no doubt about him being a
good deal more when he is alive. Nevertheless, it would be a proud
thing for the Padna Dan family to have one of their kinsmen buried with
the pomp and ceremony of a mighty monarch, and they never to produce
anything more than birdcatchers and bowl players. Yes, Padna,
&lsquo;twould be a great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>thing entirely, and ye that always
lived in a house that you could put your hand down the chimney and open
the front door, if you forgot your latch-key. The mistake would never
be discovered till the Judgment Day, and then you&rsquo;d rise from
your grave, glorious and triumphant with a crown of shiny jewels on
your head, and a royal sceptre in your hand, and a robe of state that
would cover you all over, and you looking as happy and contented as
though you were used to wearing overcoats all your lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about yourself, Micus,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;and
you with a red cap on your head, like the dukes wear on state
occasions, and a snowball in one hand and a bear&rsquo;s claw in the
other, the way the people would think you were the Duke of the North
Pole and not yourself at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be a
duke at any time than have to work for a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;And in that sense, we
only echo the true sentiments of every democrat. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>Yet,
when I was a young man, I never bothered my head about royalty, but I
was as full of wild fancies as a balloon is of wind. And there
wasn&rsquo;t one from the Old Head of Kinsale to the Giants&rsquo;
Causeway more headstrong and intolerant than myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe every word of that,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like other temperamental and idealistic people, I naturally
felt very disappointed and likewise disgusted with the existing order
of things, and there and then I ses to myself: &lsquo;Padna Dan,&rsquo;
ses I, &lsquo;the world is in a wretched condition and badly wants a
great reformer.&rsquo; So with that I appointed myself mediator between
good and evil, and indeed, at first I thought it would be possible to
form some kind of compromise between those two giant forces that have
kept the world in awe ever since Adam was a boy. But subsequently I
decided that the best and only thing to do would be to rid the world of
evil altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how could that be done at all?&rdquo; said Micus.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I was filled with the enthusiasm and ignorance of
youth, I tried to make up my mind whether I would follow in the
footsteps of Savonarola, St. Francis, or St. Patrick himself, but when
I thought of what happened to Savonarola, and after all these years we
don&rsquo;t know whether St. Patrick was a Scotchman or an Irishman,
but principally when I took into consideration my own strong sense of
personal comfort, and my insignificance withal, when compared to
greater men who have suffered so much and accomplished so little, I
finally decided to leave the regeneration of mankind to the
suffragettes or some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a philosopher,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m afraid that you will accomplish no more for humanity with
your old talk, than a patent medicine advertisement or the police
themselves. Sure, every young man with a spark of decency in him must
have felt as generous as yourself at some time or other in his life. If
we could all reform ourselves before trying to reform others, then
there would be some hope for mankind, but generous impulses such as
yours, Padna Dan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>are only produced by the assimilation of
black coffee or strong tea, or else an innate conceit. When the Lord
made the world, he must have known the kind of people he was going to
put there. Hence, Padna, the superabundance of people like yourself to
be met with everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;whether we mean what we say
or not, we must keep talking. Sure, &rsquo;tis talk that keeps the
world going, and if we are not dead in a hundred years, we will be very
near it, so it behooves us one and all to enjoy ourselves while we are
here, lest it may be unwise to postpone our pleasure until we arrive in
the other world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This world,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;in a sense, is good
enough for me, and I wouldn&rsquo;t object to living on here for ever,
if I could, instead of taking a chance with what&rsquo;s to
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is a game of ups and downs, and love very often is an
accident. If we did not meet our wives, we never would have married
them, of course. And if our wives did not meet us, they might have met
some one better. And happy indeed is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>man who marries the
woman he loves before she marries some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis sad to think,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;that when
we get sensible enough to appreciate our own folly, the beauties of
nature, and the idiosyncracies of our friends and enemies, we find
ourselves on the brink of the grave. Yet, we might all be worse off and
treated no better than the poor prisoners of Sarduanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all prisoners, in a sense, from the very minute we are
born, and we may be prisoners after we are dead too, for all any of us
know,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;but nevertheless, some
of us know how to treat ourselves better than the authorities treat the
prisoners of Sarduanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how are they treated at all? Is it the way they get too
much to eat and not enough of work, or too much work and not enough to
eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t so much one as the other, but something
worse than either. They get nothing to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>eat but pickled pork
from one end of the year to the other,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do they get to quench their thirst?&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt fish,&rdquo; said Padna. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Folly of Being Foolish</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; said Padna Dan
to Micus Pat, as he watched him sifting sand between his fingers as he
stood on the shore of Bantry Bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing what nobody ever thought of doing before and
what no one may ever think of doing again,&rdquo; said Micus.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting the pebbles of Bantry Bay from Dunboy to
Glengarriffe. And that&rsquo;s more than Napoleon thought of
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should you be doing the likes of that?&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;when they&rsquo;re all
counted, I&rsquo;ll know more than before and be as famous as the King
of Spain himself.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well be trying to count all the blades of grass
from Dunkirk to Belgrade, but you&rsquo;d be dead and forgotten long
before you&rsquo;d have as much as the ten thousandth part of half of
them counted,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about counting pebbles or the red skeeories
that does be on the white thorn-bushes in the month of August?&rdquo;
said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as any sensible man wants to know,&rdquo; said Padna.
&ldquo;If you want to be really foolish, you ought to leave the pebbles
alone, and start counting all the grains of sand in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll count the pebbles first,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis only vanity that makes a man do what every one
else is too sensible to do,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;But &rsquo;tis
better to be foolish itself and get married than to be so vain that you
don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should I get married?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s wife is always
a great comfort to him when he wants to get fed, when he&rsquo;s sick
in bed and requires nursing, or when he&rsquo;s too well off and
suffers from discontent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>Besides, &rsquo;tis a great thing
to have a wife to quarrel with when you&rsquo;re afraid of quarreling
with any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should I quarrel with my wife without reason if I had
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abuse, you know, is the great safety valve that keeps the
world from exploding, and if you won&rsquo;t abuse your wife,
she&rsquo;ll abuse you,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;and isn&rsquo;t it
better to be first than last in anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather be the last than the first man to meet a widow looking for a
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no escape from widows,&rdquo; said Micus,
&ldquo;whatever accidents might happen with inexperienced young
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in what you say,&rdquo; said Padna.
&ldquo;Perseverance, pugnacity, and stupidity are necessary for success
if you aren&rsquo;t cursed with intelligence and good breeding. And you
can get any young woman without money to marry you against her will,
but if you&rsquo;re wise enough you <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>won&rsquo;t. I need
not tell you that lovers are only sensible when they commence wondering
at the foolishness of their own children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man thinking about getting married should have two women to
choose from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why, might I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, because if he lost one he could have the other, and if
he lost both he would know what it is to be lucky. Marriage, you know,
always makes one master and two slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too bad that there should be any
slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, but while men will marry for love, and women for
money, we cannot expect a change in our social conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no change in the world while men suffering from
indigestion will marry cooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a wise thing for a sensible man to do. A cranky
and delicate man should marry a nurse, a man always out of employment
should marry a dressmaker, and a man fond of quietness and reading
should live with a married sister, if she has no children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisha, after all&rsquo;s said and done, there&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>nothing worse nor better than being a bachelor,
as the case may be. &rsquo;Tis better to be a bachelor, I&rsquo;m
thinking, for you may go to your grave without being disillusioned. But
when a man&rsquo;s dead, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether he was married
or not, or shot by an ivory-handled revolver or died from
rheumatics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man suffering from rheumatics should be mindful of the
westerly gales, and the frosts of winter, and keep from eating salty
beef and tomatoes. I think a rheumaticky man should get married, but
should not marry a woman with a tendency to gout. And &rsquo;tis always
well to marry an orphan because there&rsquo;s nothing worse than
mothers-in-law, except sisters-in-law, and they&rsquo;re the devil
entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To change the subject,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think it is fair to catch lobsters at night. No one wants
to be disturbed in their sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look at things like that,&rdquo; said Padna,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never be happy, and though it isn&rsquo;t easy to
please myself, I think &rsquo;tis a grand thing entirely that all
caterpillars are vegetarians.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should waste time talking about
caterpillars. They never do anything but eat cabbage and cause
gardeners to use bad language. Of course, the history of a buffalo or a
butterfly is a wonderful thing, but if elephants were to grow wings we
wouldn&rsquo;t take any notice of canaries, bees, or water hens,&rdquo;
said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a lot of money to see a flock of elephants
flying over the Rock of Cashel,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a great thing for the newspapers and the moving
pictures, though perhaps a dangerous thing for people of a nervous
disposition,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &lsquo;twould be the devil of a thing entirely if they
forgot to fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nervousness is a curse or a blessing, according to the
individual, of course. The evil that some men do lives after them, and
the good does be interred with their bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but when men do neither good nor harm they
might as well keep out of politics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>altogether. No man is as wise
or as foolish as he thinks he is, and if you were to capture all the
stray thoughts that does be floating about in your head and put them
down in writing, you&rsquo;d be the greatest curiosity that ever
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man loses a button,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;he
should immediately sew it on for himself, if he couldn&rsquo;t get any
one to do it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selfishness is the basis of success,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To give away what you don&rsquo;t want is wisdom without
generosity, and to keep what is of no use to you is the worst kind of
folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fighting is a natural instinct, and to fight for what&rsquo;s
yours, be it honor or property, is a noble thing, but to fight for what
doesn&rsquo;t belong to you is both dangerous and foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so indeed. I saw two crows fighting for a crust
of bread that a child dropped in the street, and they didn&rsquo;t
cease until both had their eyes picked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who got the crust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sparrow who came along while they were fighting, and
devoured it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"
name="pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the crows without knowing it became
philanthropists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis better to make mistakes if some one benefits
by them than to make no mistakes at all. I think I&rsquo;ll go on
counting the pebbles and leave you to find a philosophy for
yourself,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;when a man can content
himself by being foolish, &rsquo;tis only a fool that would be a
philosopher.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">The Lady of the Moon</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a strange thing,&rdquo; said Padna
to Micus, as he sat on a boulder in his back garden, carving a
dog&rsquo;s head on the handle of a blackthorn walking stick,
&ldquo;that notwithstanding all the millions of people in the world, no
two are alike, and stranger still that no two leaves of a tree, or
blades of grass, are alike either. And while in a sense we are always
doing something for others, &rsquo;tis ourselves we do be thinking
about most of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, very true! And as they say across the water:
&lsquo;Every man for himself, and the dollar for us all.&rsquo; Or as
the Devil said when he joined the police force: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no
one like our own,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is full of surprises, and the world is full <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>of
strange people,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;And &rsquo;tis a good job
that we are like the leaves of the trees, and the blades of grass, so
alike and yet so different. If we all had the same tastes, we might
have no taste at all, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of strange people,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;I
wonder if you ever heard tell of one Malachi Riordan who used to sit in
his back yard, every fine night, watching the reflection of the moon in
a bucket of water, hoping to find the evening star with the aid of his
wife&rsquo;s spectacles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not then,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;But I met just as
strange a man, and he sitting on his hat on the banks of the Fairy Lake
of Lisnavarna, watching the moon&rsquo;s reflection in the clear
waters, and the devil a one of him knew that he was contrary at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure if a man was contrary, he wouldn&rsquo;t know it, and if
he was told he was contrary, he wouldn&rsquo;t believe it, but think
that every one was contrary but himself,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;And
I believe the Lake at Lisnavarna has a fatal fascination for people who
are as sensible as ourselves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165"
href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>&rsquo;Twas there that Matty
Morrissey, the great fiddler of Arnaliska, and the holy Bishop of
Clonmorna met their doom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were driving in an open carriage along the lonely roads
at the dead of night,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;and no finer carriage
was ever seen, with its two wheels behind and its two wheels before,
and a special seat for the driver, and cushions fit for a duke to sit
on, and the Arms of the Four Provinces painted on the doors,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were they driving to?&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were driving at breakneck speed to the little thatched
chapel on the Hill of Meath, with its marble altar, red-tiled floor,
painted Stations of the Cross, and beautiful silver candlesticks, for
the Bishop was in the devil of a hurry to marry Queen Maeve to the
Crown Prince of Spain, and Matty Morrissey was to play the music for
the dancers after the wedding. But, lo and behold! as the carriage
rattled along the dark, winding roads, the holy Bishop, Matty, and the
driver fell fast asleep, and the horse fell asleep also, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>but
he was a somnambulist and kept galloping away the same as if he was
wide-awake, and when he came to the lake, he plunged into its silent
waters, carrying with him the occupants of the carriage, and they all
sank to its icy depths the same as if they were made of lead, and they
were never heard of from that fatal hour to this blessed
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t some one try to recover their bodies and
give them a public funeral and christian burial?&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be the use? Sure there is no bottom at all to the
Lake of Lisnavarna. And you might as well be looking for a Christmas
box from the Devil himself as to be looking for any one who gets
drowned there,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sad story,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;But
&rsquo;tis better to be drowned inself than roasted to death in a
forest fire, or worse still, talked to death by your mother-in-law or
some of your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk is a deadly instrument of torture,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis indeed,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;and sometimes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>as bad as silence, but tell me how the disaster
affected Queen Maeve and the Crown Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Queen Maeve wept so much that she lost her beauty, and
the Crown Prince married a farmer&rsquo;s daughter who had a dowry of
three stockingsful of sovereigns, thirty-three acres of loamy soil,
three cows, and three clucking hens,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a sad world for some,&rdquo; said Padna.
&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis my belief that the best as well as the worst of
us don&rsquo;t give a traneen about women once they lose their
beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my belief also,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;Yet
only for women there would be no love, and love is the greatest thing
in all the world. It is an echo of Heaven&rsquo;s glory, so to speak,
and when denied us we don&rsquo;t live at all. Without love we are
nothing more nor less than dead men, stalking about from place to
place, clutching on to this thing and that thing with the hope that we
will be compensated for what we have missed. For what, might I ask, is
a dog or a cat or a heap of money itself to a man or woman, when the
dark <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>nights come and the frost and snow does be on
the ground, and the wind blows down the chimney? And even though we
might have plenty faggots for the fire and plenty food in the cupboard,
and more than we want for ourselves, what good is it all, unless we
have some one to share it with us? &rsquo;Tis by sharing with others
that we bring ourselves nearer to God. And He has given the earth and
all it contains to the good and bad alike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis by sharing with ourselves and being decent to
ourselves on all occasions that we acquire wisdom,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, now let me hear about the stranger you met
at the Fairy Lake,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;as I approached him I up and
ses: &lsquo;Good night, stranger,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good night kindly,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a fine night, thank God,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a glorious night,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;But
why do you come here to interrupt me, and I enjoying myself without any
expense to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;if you didn&rsquo;t interrupt
some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>people, they would never cease doing foolish
things, and if you didn&rsquo;t interrupt others they would never make
any progress. And if we never asked questions we might be as ignorant
as the schoolmasters themselves. &rsquo;Tis only by studying others
that we can find out how wise or foolish we are ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That may be, but curiosity is the cause of all
trouble,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Curiosity is a sign of intelligence,&rsquo; ses I.
&lsquo;Because only for it we mightn&rsquo;t try and find out what
others were doing, and they might steal a march on ourselves, so to
speak, by taking advantage of our indifference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Howsomever,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;what is it to you
what I am doing? If we were only half as interested in our own affairs,
as we are in those of others, &lsquo;twould be a good job for us all.
Then we might achieve some success, but while we will keep bothering
ourselves about others and keep bothering others about ourselves, we
can&rsquo;t expect either ourselves or any one else to be happy,&rsquo;
ses he. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, bedad,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
something, if not a good deal, in what you say; still and all, if we
weren&rsquo;t a source of annoyance to our neighbours, and if our
neighbours weren&rsquo;t a source of annoyance to us, we might all die
of inanition, and the whole globe might become nothing more or less
than a beautiful garden, for the wild animals of the jungle, the birds
of the air, and varmints like rats, mice, and cockroaches,&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, my good sir,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;if you could
have all your questions answered, you would become too wise, and then
you would get so disgusted with yourself and every one else that you
might take it into your head to jump from the top of some high cliff
into a raging sea and end your life in that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I was going to commit suicide, at all,&rsquo; ses
I, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis the way I&rsquo;d pay some one to put poison in my
ear while I would be asleep, and die like the King of Denmark
himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your conceit is refreshing! Not alone would you have
your name in the paper for being a suicide, but for aiding and abetting
in your own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>murder as well. &lsquo;Twould be a clear case of
dying by another&rsquo;s hand at your own instigation. But now to your
query. You asked me what I was looking at in the lake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe I did,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I was looking at the lady
in the moon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The lady in the moon!&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;the lady in the
moon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure, I always thought there was only a man in the
moon,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a lady there too, but don&rsquo;t tell
any one,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you afraid any one might run away with her?&rsquo;
ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I am and I am not,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When did you discover that there was a lady in the
moon?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Years and years ago when I was a young man of three
sixes,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord save us all!&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;And you
never told the scientists about it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I did not,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;They should have
found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>it out for themselves. There&rsquo;s many a
thing that the scientists don&rsquo;t know, and many a thing that the
clergy don&rsquo;t know, and many a thing that the very wisest of us
don&rsquo;t know, but there is one thing that we all know,&rsquo; ses
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what is that?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some day we will all be as dead as decency. But
nevertheless it doesn&rsquo;t make us treat each other a bit
better,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The uncertainty of everything is the only certainty we
have,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;And very few of us say anything worth
thinking about, and what most of us think is not worth talking about.
However, I&rsquo;d like to know whether the moon was in the east or the
west when you discovered the lady that captured your heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas in this very lake the moon was when I saw
my love for the first time, and though some fifty years or more have
passed since then, she is as beautiful, lithe, lissome, and gay as
ever, and she as elegant as Helen of Troy herself,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking at the moon all my
lifetime,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;in pools of water, lakes, rivers, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>the sky itself, and the devil a one I ever saw
in it at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not a bit surprising,&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;Some walk from the cradle to the grave without noticing the
beauty of the universe, and what&rsquo;s more, they are never impressed
with what&rsquo;s extraordinary, or surprised at the obvious. And when
they see the things they have heard so much about, they do be surprised
at what they think is the stupidity of the intelligent people, because
they have no sense of the beautiful themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God knows,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;there are women enough
on the face of the earth without going to look for them in the moon,
nevertheless, I&rsquo;d like to see the lady that&rsquo;s as purty as
Helen of Troy, and she more beautiful than all the queens of the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;if you want to see the
lady of the moon, you must take a hop, step, and a jump forward, and a
hop, step, and a jump, backward, then turn on your heel three times,
bore a hole in the crown of your hat with the buckhorn handle of your
blackthorn, put your face in the hat itself, look through the hole the
way you&rsquo;d look at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>the stars through a telescope, and
you&rsquo;ll see the lady I fell head and heels in love with when I was
a lad of three sixes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;that would be a queer
thing for me to do. Sure while I&rsquo;d have my face in the hat, you
might run behind me and give me one kick and pitch me headlong into the
lake, and I&rsquo;d be sinking in its icy waters for ever like Matty
Morrissey the fiddler, and the holy Bishop of Clonmorna.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God forgive you for having such an evil mind,&rsquo;
ses he. &lsquo;I that never did hurt nor harm to any one in all my born
days, but myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;a man always makes a fool
of himself about women, and he might as well make a fool of himself one
way as another, and as I won&rsquo;t be making a precedent by doing
something idiotic to please another, I&rsquo;ll bore a hole in my hat,
though I&rsquo;d rather bore one in yours, and try if I can&rsquo;t see
the lady.&rsquo; And as true as I&rsquo;m telling you, I looked through
the hole and saw the lady of the moon for the first time, and then I up
and ses to the stranger: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What kind of a man are you to remain a bachelor all
those long years, and to be coming here night after night, when the
moon shows in the sky, wasting your affection on a lady you never
opened your lips to?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m the happiest man alive,&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;Because the woman I love has never wounded or slighted me in any
way, and what&rsquo;s more, she never will. She don&rsquo;t want to be
going out to balls and parties at night, and gallivanting with other
women&rsquo;s husbands, and she cares as little about the latest
fashions as I do myself. And we have never had as much as a single
quarrel, and we are the same to each other now as when first we met. I
have yet to be disillusioned,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s
something worth boasting about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;for all you know, the lady
of the moon might be in love with the man in the moon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;And maybe your
wife might be in love with the man next door, or across the street, or
some one away in the wilds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href=
"#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>of Africa, Australia, or America,
or she may be in love with some one who&rsquo;s dead and gone, or some
good-looking stranger who came into her life for a day or a week and
went out of it for ever. Women can keep their own secrets,&rsquo; ses
he. &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t tell us all they think, and very often when
they say no, they mean yes. You have a lot to learn,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe I have,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;But &rsquo;tis as
bad for a man to know too much or too little, as to know nothing at
all, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe it is,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And when are you going to wed the lady in the moon? Is
it when she comes down from the sky?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;but when she comes up from
the lake.&rsquo; And then a large dark cloud floated past and the lady
of the moon was seen no more that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis about time we went indoors,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;The Angelus is ringing,
and I&rsquo;m feeling hungry.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A blue haze hung on the distant hills when Padna Dan
looked pensively from the landscape to his watch, and said to his
friend Micus Pat, who stood by his side: &ldquo;The world is surely a
wonderful and a beautiful place as well; but it would seem as though
there were wings on the feet of time, so quickly does night follow
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is the barque that carries us from the cradle to the
grave, and leaves us on the shores of the other world alone,&rdquo;
said Padna. &ldquo;And as my poor mother used to say:</p>
<div class="lgouter xd20e2332">
<p class="line">Time, like youth, will have its fling,</p>
<p class="line">And of a beggar make a king;</p>
<p class="line">And of a king a beggar make,</p>
<p class="line">Merely for a joke&rsquo;s sake.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>Time indeed brings many changes. Cromwell made peasants of the Irish
gentry, and America made gentry of the Irish peasantry, and awful snobs
some of them became too! But a whit for snobbery, for what is it but an
adjunct of prosperity, like gout, which disappears again with
adversity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snobbery at best is a foolish thing,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when we consider the unimportance of our own troubles,
and the importance of the principal parts of the British Empire, such
as Ireland, England, Scotland, Australia and T. P. O&rsquo;Connor, our
insignificance looms up before our gaze, and almost strikes us in the
face, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis surprising it doesn&rsquo;t obliterate us
altogether,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;However, let us forget Tay Pay
O&rsquo;Connor for a little while, as he will never do so himself, and
I will tell you a story about one Cormac McShane from the townland of
Ballinderry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On with the story; I am always glad to hear tell of some one
worth talking about,&rdquo; said Micus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;Cormac was as fine a looking
man as ever broke his promises. And unless you had great astuteness of
observation, and an eye like a hawk or a landlady, you wouldn&rsquo;t
see the likes of him in a twelvemonth, even though you might be
gallivanting through the streets every day. And while nature treated
him rather well, for the poor man he was, Dame Fortune seemed to have
ignored him altogether, until he took his fate in his own hands, and
then things began to improve. But to make a short story as long as I
can, like the journalists and modern novelists, one day while Cormac
was sitting in a barber&rsquo;s chair, having his hair cut and trying
to forget what the barber was talking about, a bright idea came to him
as he caught a glimpse of himself in the looking-glass, and lo and
behold! without saying a word, he jumped up and stood on his two feet,
and the poor barber got so excited that he cut a piece off the top of
his right ear. Cormac wasn&rsquo;t the least displeased, because he
always thought that his ears were too long, so then and there he told
the barber to cut a piece about the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>same length off his
other ear, so that they would both look nice and even. And when his
wishes were complied with, he thanked the barber, and then he up and
ses to himself: &lsquo;Cormac McShane,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I never
before thought you were such a good-looking fellow. Sure the King of
Spain or the Emperor of China would feel as proud as a peacock to have
a countenance like yours. Yet,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t it a
strange thing that one so handsome, and modest likewise, and with such
a splendid appetite, and a taste for good things in general, should be
compelled by stress of circumstances to live on pigs&rsquo; heads, and
tough cabbage, and no change at all in your dietary but salt conger
eels on Fridays. Why,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;a man with your
appreciation should have plenty of the choice things of life, and never
know the want of anything. What, might I ask,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;has
the world achieved by all the books that have been written, and all the
charity sermons that have been preached, when you, Cormac McShane,
couldn&rsquo;t go from Cork to Dublin unless you borrowed the money,
and it might be as hard for you to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181"
href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>borrow it, as &lsquo;twould
be for yourself to lend it to another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good sound talk,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;Go on
with the story, and don&rsquo;t let any one interrupt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; ses Cormac, &lsquo;If every one in the
whole world from Peru to Clonakilty would only give you a halfpenny
each, and no one would miss such a trifle, you would be the richest man
alive, and then you needn&rsquo;t give a traneen about any one. But, of
course,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;that would be too much originality to
expect from the bewildered inhabitants of the globe, moreover,&rsquo;
ses he, &lsquo;when we consider that the majority of people are always
trying to get something for nothing, themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had the temperament of a millionaire,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, he had, and the ingenuity of the tinkers, who would
charge for putting a patch on a skillet where there was no hole at
all,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;&lsquo;However,&rsquo; ses Cormac to
himself, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing like money, no matter how it may
have been earned, and every man should be his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>own
counsellor, because the little we know about each other only leads us
into confusion and chaos. Now,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;very few ever
became wealthy by hard work alone, and you, Cormac McShane, must think
of some scheme by which you can become rich, and all of a sudden
too.&rsquo; And so he exercised his brains for about a month, and kept
thinking and thinking, until finally he managed to capture an idea that
he found straying among all the wild fancies that ever kept buzzing
about in his head. And he was so pleased and delighted that he ses to
himself: &lsquo;Cormac,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;there isn&rsquo;t another
man alive who could think of such a short cut to wealth, health, and
happiness, and as a mark of my appreciation, I will now treat you to
whatever you may want, provided, of course, that it won&rsquo;t cost
more than one shilling. A shilling is enough to spend on any one at a
time, unless you are sure of getting two shillings, worth in return.
And extravagance is nearly as bad as economy, when it isn&rsquo;t used
to advantage.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the brilliant idea that inspired <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>such
generosity?&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;Was it the way he made up his
mind to dress himself as a duke, and go to America and marry some
heiress who couldn&rsquo;t tell a duke from a professional plausible
humbug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anything as commonplace as that,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it then?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to raffle myself at a guinea a
ticket,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;And if I will sell five hundred, I will
have enough to buy a small farm. That would give me a real start in
life, and after I have what I want, discontent is possible.&rsquo; And
then and there, he got his photo printed on a card, on which was
written:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&lsquo;<span class="sc">A Bargain of
Bargains</span></p>
<p><i>To be raffled, and drawn for, on St. Swithin&rsquo;s eve, at the
Black Cock Tavern, one Cormac McShane. He stands five feet six inches
in his stocking vamps, black hair, blue eyes, an easy disposition, and
no poor relations. A limited number <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>of tickets, to wit,
five hundred, will be sold at one guinea each, to widows without
children, of less than three score and five.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;the devil be in it, but that
was the most extraordinary way I ever heard of a man looking for a wife
with a fortune. And why did he make the stipulation that only widows
were eligible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because widows are always less extravagant than single women,
and they know how to humour a man better, when he has lost his
temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many tickets did he sell?&rdquo; asked Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every single one, and he could have sold as many more, only
he hadn&rsquo;t them printed,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was how Cormac McShane got a wife, or how a wife got
him, if you will?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;and while the money lasted,
Cormac was the happiest man in the country.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;if Cormac McShane was a wise
man, Garret Doran was another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;Was it the way he always
kept his mouth shut until he had something to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;But he could do that
too, when it pleased him. Garret was a miller, who kept a mill near the
courthouse, so one day when the famous judge, Patcheen the Piper, as he
was called, was sitting on the Bench, passing sentence on a batch of
patriots who were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, for no other
offence than loving a country that never did anything for them better
than they loved themselves, a great noise was heard, and the Judge was
so annoyed at being disturbed that he stopped short in the middle of
the death sentence and ses, at the top of his voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What hullaballoo is that I hear? And who dares make
any noise at all, and interfere with my amusement?&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;If I will hear another sound, I&rsquo;ll order every one within
a radius of five miles to be boiled in turpentine, and sealed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>up in tin cans, and have them shipped to the
King of the Cannibal Islands, as a Christmas box from the people of
generous Ireland,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the Crown Solicitor,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s only Garret Doran&rsquo;s mill grinding corn for
the poor people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The poor people!&rsquo; ses the Judge in a rage.
&lsquo;Who the devil cares a traneen about the poor but the politicians
when they want to get their votes, the kings and emperors when they
want them to go to the wars, or the clergy when they are preaching
charity sermons for the benefit of the inhabitants of Central Africa?
And who will deny that those cannibals wouldn&rsquo;t be better off if
they were left alone? Nevertheless, &rsquo;tis only fair to state that
they have just as much appreciation of decency and kindness as the best
of ourselves. But be all that as it may, go and tell Garret Doran to
stop his mill at once, and if he don&rsquo;t obey your orders, bring
him here before me, and I&rsquo;ll order him to be hanged with these
poor fools of patriots who have done less to annoy me than he has. And
hanging patriots, if you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>haven&rsquo;t a conscience, is as
good a way of making a living, as starving your employees to death,
like some of the pious-faced rascals who have the impudence to invite
myself to dine with them. Not indeed, that the likes of me wants a
dinner or a meal of food from any one. The poor, who can&rsquo;t afford
a square meal more than once in the year, are never invited to partake
of the hospitality of those who give dinners to those who don&rsquo;t
need them. But why should I bother about anything in a world like this,
where everything is in such a hopeless state of confusion? Howsomever,
a judge, like a lawyer, has to live down to the dignity of his
profession, and unless he hangs a man now and again, the Government
might think he had no interest in his job at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;when we think of the
number of useless and troublesome people in the world and the few who
find their way to the gallows, we should not worry about them, unless
they might happen to be some relation of our own. The only time we
really take an interest in other people&rsquo;s troubles is when such
troubles <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>affect ourselves. Nevertheless,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;this is a rather lengthy digression, so be off with yourself at
once to Garret Doran, and tell him his mill must be stopped this very
instant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the Crown Solicitor went to Garret and told him what
the Judge had said, and Garret ordered the mill to be stopped, and the
Judge received no further trouble from Garret or his mill while the
trial lasted. And when the Assizes were over, the Judge went away, and
he didn&rsquo;t return again for five years. But when he was sitting on
the Bench again for himself, passing sentence of death on more
patriots, who should walk up to him but Garret himself, and he dressed
in his Sunday clothes? And without as much as saying:
&lsquo;Good-morrow, how are you,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Go to the devil
inself,&rsquo; he up and hands him a large sealed envelope. And when
Patcheen the Piper opened and read the note it contained, his face
turned scarlet, and he jumped up from his throne of plush and gold
trimmings, and ses: &lsquo;What the blue blazes is the meaning of all
this?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited, whatever you&rsquo;ll
do,&rsquo; ses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>Garret. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis nothing more nor less
than a bill for the expenses incurred by closing down my mill at your
instigation some five years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a while the Judge said nothing at all, but kept looking
hard at Garret, and then all of a sudden ses he: &lsquo;Why, in the
name of all the descendants of Julius C&aelig;sar and Brian Boru in
America, didn&rsquo;t you start the mill going after I left the
city?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You never told me to do so,&rsquo; ses Garret.
&lsquo;And if I did start it without your permission, I might have been
sent to gaol for five hundred years or more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses the Judge, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I
can&rsquo;t send you to a warmer place than gaol to punish you for
fooling me in such a successful manner. Why, man alive,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;your conduct is preposterous; in fact, &rsquo;tis worse, because
&rsquo;tis ridiculous as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the incongruity of things that makes a
living for most of us,&rsquo; ses Garret. &lsquo;And only a fool would
get angry about anything. Anyway,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
care a traneen what happens to you, so long as I will get what is
coming to me.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190"
name="pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; ses the Judge, &lsquo;in spite of all
our old talk, that seems to be the beginning and end of human ambition.
We all like to get as much as we can for nothing, and give as little as
possible in return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to finish my story, the case was taken from the high
courts to the low courts, and from the low courts back again to the
high courts, and between the jigs and the reels, so to speak, Garret
got his money, and Patcheen the Piper never asked any one to stop a
mill again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the devil&rsquo;s own queer yarn,&rdquo; said
Padna. &ldquo;If we all had to wait until we were told what to do, we
wouldn&rsquo;t do anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Micus. <span class=

<div id="ch14" class="div1"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Shauno and the Shah</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna to his friend Micus, as
they sat on a donkey cart on their way to market, &ldquo;I wonder if
you ever heard tell of Shauno the Rover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisha, indeed I did not then. Who was he at all?&rdquo; asked
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a distant relation of my own who lived in the good old
days when women stayed at home and looked after the children and the
household,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;And he was as contrary a creature
as ever mistook ignorance for knowledge, and like all of his kind he
was as happy as the days are long when he was giving trouble to some
one else. But, bad luck to him and to all like him, he was the most
dissatisfied man that was ever allowed to have all his own way, and
&rsquo;tis said he could swear in seven languages, and swear all day
without getting tired. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href=
"#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;However, though he was queer and contrary, he was a gentleman
withal. And he was never known to use his rare vocabulary in the
presence of ladies, but would wait until their backs were turned, like
a well-trained married man, and then curse and damn them one and all to
perdition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was it the way he disliked women?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, but because he couldn&rsquo;t find any
particular one that he could like better than another. And that was why
he made up his mind to leave the country altogether, and go to foreign
parts to look for a wife who might be different from any he might find
at home,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedad,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;Shauno must have been a
genius or else a fool, and at times it takes a wise man to know one
from the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever he was, or whatever he wasn&rsquo;t, one thing is
certain, and that is, he was an excellent actor both on and off the
stage, and could play the part of poet or peasant, king or beggar, with
equal grace and naturalness. And so it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>was one day, when he
got heartily sick of all the tame nonentities he had to deal with, he
up and ses to himself: &lsquo;Shauno,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;there are
enough of mollycoddles and pious humbugs in the world without adding to
their number, and unless you will do something original now while you
are young and foolish, you are not likely to do anything but what some
one else tells you to do when you are old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And without saying another word, he went straight home,
dressed himself up as Henry the Eighth, and after paying a visit to the
mayor of the town, went on board a warship that was lying in the
harbour beyond. And when the poor captain saw Shauno attired like a
mighty monarch, he got the fright of his life, and never said a word at
all until Shauno up and ses: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a fine day,
Captain,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know that myself, already,&rsquo; ses the Captain,
&lsquo;but who in the name of all the corncrakes in Munster are you,
and what brings you here, and what can I do for you besides flinging
you overboard to the sharks and the sea gulls?&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses Shauno, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be so eager
to do something you may be sorry for. All that I want you to do is to
land me in Sperrispazuka within five days, and if you will accomplish
the feat, I will raise your wages and promote you to the rank of
admiral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who the blazes are you to come here without being
invited and give an order like that to myself?&rsquo; ses the
Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who the devil do you think I could be, or want to be,
you impudent varmint, but Henry the Eighth?&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;By
all the people I have made miserable, I&rsquo;ll have you lashed to the
mouth of a cannon, and blown to smithereens if you don&rsquo;t do what
you are told. How dare you insult the King of England and Scotland, not
to mention Ireland and Australia?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the bold Captain ses: &lsquo;I beg your Majesty&rsquo;s
pardon,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;I thought you were some play actor or
other who had lost his wits. So I hope you will accept my apology for
the mistake I have so unfortunately made, and my stupidity
likewise.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195"
name="pb195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis hard for me ever to forgive or overlook
stupidity because, like all religious people, I can&rsquo;t stand in
another the faults I have in a large measure myself. But considering
that you have been a faithful servant to the family for a number of
years, I will let you off with a caution this time. But be sure and
never make mistakes again, unless you know what you are doing,&rsquo;
ses Shauno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you for your kind advice,&rsquo; ses the
Captain. &lsquo;Is there anything I can do now to please or oblige your
Majesty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is,&rsquo; ses Shauno. &lsquo;Hold your tongue,
put full steam ahead, and tell the sailors not to say their prayers
aloud, because I am going to bed this very instant, and don&rsquo;t
want to be disturbed. But call me in the morning at eight o&rsquo;clock
sharp,&rsquo; ses Shauno. &lsquo;And be sure and have my breakfast
ready on time. I will have a busy day to-morrow. I must shave and read
the newspaper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What will you have for breakfast?&rsquo; ses the
Captain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One fathom and half of drisheen, six fresh eggs, three
loaves of bread, goat&rsquo;s ears, ostrich brains, and two heads of
cabbage. And I&rsquo;d like a toothful of something to help me to
digest the little repast,&rsquo; ses Shauno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose a keg or two of rum, or a dozen of stout,
will do,&rsquo; ses the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As there&rsquo;s luck in odd numbers, you had better
make it three dozen of stout,&rsquo; ses Shauno. &lsquo;And if I feel
like any more, I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the old fool of a captain really thought he was Henry
the Eighth, and he did everything that Shauno told him, until they
reached Sperrispazuka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the mosques and the turrets of the city hove in
sight and the ship once more lay at anchor, Shauno trod the deck with
pride and ses to the Captain: &lsquo;Captain,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;allow me to compliment you on this marvellous achievement. I
never before made the journey in such a short space of time, and in
honour of the event I will make you a present of two-and-sixpence and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>make you a Knight of Columbus besides. But
before I will take my leave of yourself and the ship, I want a royal
salute of twenty-one guns to be fired and burst every pane of glass in
the town beyond with the noise. A shout is better than a whisper if you
want to be heard, and we all get more by asking for what we want than
by remaining silent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Anyhow,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;half the world is living
on its wits, or by bluff, if you will, and the other half enjoys
itself, so to speak, at the expense of inequality, non-fraternity, and
suppression of the people&rsquo;s rights. Yet for all that, most of the
well-fed and superfine humbugs we meet every day seem to be as happy
and contented as if they deserved to be. And all you have got to do to
convince yourself that the wisdom of man has not interfered with the
extravagance of women is to look at the way they dress, or look at your
bank book at the end of the year if you are married. But be all that as
it may, I think that I have said enough, for talk is always cheap, and
&rsquo;tis doubtful if anything that&rsquo;s cheap <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>or
given away for nothing is ever appreciated by the discerning or the
undiscerning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;as I have but a few
more words to say, I would advise you, one and all, to be decent to
each other while you can, because a time will come when you
can&rsquo;t. And &rsquo;tis better to do a foolish thing now than to be
sorry for not doing it later. On the other hand, &rsquo;tis a wise
policy to refuse anything you may be offered for nothing, because a
compliment bestowed is always like a millstone around a man&rsquo;s
neck. Independence, of course, is a fine thing, but it is always
purchased at too high a price. And a state of independence is only
acquired by either cheating yourself or some one else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But nevertheless,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;the man who
always thinks of himself first is the last to be neglected. And the man
who don&rsquo;t hold his tongue when he has nothing to say is nearly
sure to make a fool of himself. Howsomever, the time is now come for me
to make my departure. So let loose the guns,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and
fire the Royal Salute.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199"
href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And lo and behold! the Captain obeyed his orders, and such
noise was never before heard in the harbour of Sperrispazuka. And when
silence was resumed Shauno whispered to the Captain and ses:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to sojourn here for a month or two, and
I&rsquo;ll send a telegram to you to call for me when I am ready to
return.&rsquo; So with that they shook hands and parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the ship sailed away, Shauno went ashore and walked
around the town until he found a menagerie. Then he hired a complement
of one hundred elephants, and numerous pages and attendants, flags,
banners, caravans, and the devil knows what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he want the elephants for?&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was going to visit the Shah,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;and
he wanted to make a good impression. And when all the elephants were
placed one after another in a line, he took the place of honour himself
on the back of the first and largest of the great brutes. And as the
procession passed on its way through the town to the Shah&rsquo;s
country <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>home, the House of Ten Thousand Windows,
everybody&mdash;men, women, and children alike&mdash;stopped in the
streets and took off their hats, thinking that Shauno was the King of
England, and he was beginning to think so too, or at least that he was
as great an old bla&rsquo;guard as Henry himself. But when he arrived
at the castle gates and found the Shah sitting on his tombstone feeding
the pigeons, he was sorely disappointed, because he expected a royal
escort to meet him outside the courtyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Shah was kind of startled when he saw Shauno and his
staff, and nearly lost his temper and ses: &lsquo;Who in the name of
the few decent people that a man meets in the course of a lifetime, are
you? And who the devil owns these Irish terriers?&rsquo; ses he, as he
pointed to the elephants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, bad luck and a dozen daughters to you,&rsquo;
ses Shauno, &lsquo;what do the likes of you mean by offering insults to
a distinguished foreigner like myself? If you read the newspapers as
you should, you would know that I was Henry the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>Eighth, and that these quadrupeds are neither
Irish terriers nor mosquitoes, but elephants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that so?&rsquo; ses the Shah. &lsquo;Wait till I
will put on my glasses. My sight is somewhat impaired from reading the
names of all my wives and their pedigrees.&rsquo; And then he put on
his glasses and ses: &lsquo;Bedad, sure enough, they are not Irish
terriers at all, but real live elephants. And &rsquo;tis yourself is no
one else but Henry the Eighth. I hope to be excused and forgiven for my
mistake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll forgive you this time,&rsquo; ses
Shauno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; ses the Shah, &lsquo;you might as
well come inside and sit down if you are in no hurry, and we will see
if we can&rsquo;t enjoy ourselves, and I will get my servants to look
after the terriers, I mean the elephants, while we&rsquo;ll make
merry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The devil a hurry, or a flurry, am I in,&rsquo; ses
Shauno. And with that they adjourned to the Shah&rsquo;s drawing-room,
and when they were comfortably seated in two armchairs, the Shah rang
for a servant to fetch the decanter and a pack of cards. And when the
cards were placed on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202"
name="pb202">202</a>]</span>the table, the Shah grabbed them up and ses
to Shauno: &lsquo;What is it going to be? A game of Forty-Five, or
what? There&rsquo;s nothing like a game of cards to pass a dull hour
among dull people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Forty-Five, of course,&rsquo; ses Shauno, as he poured
out a glass of whiskey for himself and another for the Shah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right you are,&rsquo; ses the Shah.
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to beat a game of Forty-Five, except a
good game of bowls on a hard straight road on a winter&rsquo;s day.
Howsomever, I won&rsquo;t give you a demonstration on the art of
bowl-playing now, but I will show you how to deal the cards in the true
Carrigaline fashion, as introduced by the King of Spain while he was
here on a visit many years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; ses Shauno, &lsquo;I think the
Clonakilty, or the Skibbereen deal is just as good, but as they are all
the same, we won&rsquo;t allow the matter be a subject for
discussion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cards were duly dealt, and the Shah ses to Shauno:
&lsquo;What will we play for at all?&rsquo; ses he. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Small stakes for a start, of course,&rsquo; ses
Shauno. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll back every ship in my navy against every ship
in yours, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Done,&rsquo; ses the Shah, as he placed the decanter
on his head and finished the whiskey. Then they took off their coats,
and after an exciting game the Shah won. Shauno was very much surprised
and disappointed, and said as he pointed to the decanter to have it
filled again: &lsquo;Damn the bit of luck have I had since I met a
red-headed widow two months ago first thing on a Monday morning, and
I&rsquo;m afraid I will never have any luck again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about that, if I were you. We
will be all dead one day, and then we won&rsquo;t know whether we were
lucky or not,&rsquo; ses the Shah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s cold comfort, as the cat said after she
jumped into the freezing water when chased by a mad dog. I have ruined
my country by my extravagance. She is no longer Mistress of the Seas,
and though that may be a consolation to Germany, it will lose for me a
good deal of prestige. Howsomever, I am not dead broke yet, and even if
a man is dead broke inself, there is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>no reason why he
should go whining about it. A good gambler never cares whose money he
spends or how much he loses. I will now,&rsquo; ses he<span class=
"corr" id="xd20e2569" title="Not in source">,</span> &lsquo;back
Ireland against what I have lost and keep up the custom of my country
by treating the Irish with contempt and injustice. So let us play
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; ses the Shah. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll play
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give them the tinker&rsquo;s deal for luck
this time,&rsquo; ses Shauno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you please,&rsquo; ses the Shah. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis
all the same to me, so long as I win. A good gambler never cares how
much he takes from his friends, or how many people he makes
miserable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time they played a great game, but Shauno lost again,
and it made him more angry than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;that I have lost Ireland,
it doesn&rsquo;t matter what happens to the rest of my territory.
We&rsquo;ll play one game of Twenty-Five, and I&rsquo;ll back my boots,
my meerschaum pipe, five ounces of tobacco, and Australia against
Ireland and my fleet.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you are getting reckless?&rsquo;
ses the Shah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I may be,&rsquo; ses Shauno. &lsquo;But I might as
well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. And one poor man more or less
won&rsquo;t make much difference. On with the game. Philosophy is only
a comfort to a man when he isn&rsquo;t in a state of
desperation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you will,&rsquo; ses the Shah. &lsquo;Anything at
all to please you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the cards were dealt once more and they played a game of
Twenty-Five, and the Shah scored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shauno lost his temper and commenced to swear and break up
the furniture, but the Shah only looked on and smiled. Then Shauno
flung a chair at him, and ses: &lsquo;You bleddy foreign rascal, sure
&rsquo;tis myself that&rsquo;s the fool for having anything to do with
the likes of you. I&rsquo;ll never be able to face home now, after all
the misfortune I have had.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the Shah, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
behave like that if I were you. &rsquo;Tis undignified to appear
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>natural in the presence of strangers. We should
always reserve ingratitude and bad treatment for our friends. You are a
little upset, of course, for losing what didn&rsquo;t belong to you,
but you will feel all right again as soon as you will begin to acquire
what you don&rsquo;t deserve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I had my own way,&mdash;&rsquo; ses Shauno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If we all had our own way, the little glimmer of
democracy and decency that we see struggling for existence occasionally
would disappear for ever,&rsquo; ses the Shah. &lsquo;Howsomever,
don&rsquo;t be downhearted, but take a good drop of poteen, and
&lsquo;twill give you all the false courage that any man
wants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he produced a small keg of the best poteen, and they
drank glass after glass, and sang all the songs they could remember,
from &lsquo;The Croppy Boy&rsquo; to the &lsquo;Bard of Armagh,&rsquo;
until they fell on the floor and had to be taken to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there they slept for two days and three nights, and on
the morning of the third day, Shauno woke up with a bursting headache,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>asked the Shah if he was still alive and in the
land of the living. And the Shah was surprised that a real aristocrat
should be so upset and affected by a night&rsquo;s innocent amusement.
Well, they had breakfast together, and after the repast, the Shah took
Shauno to see the sights, and when they arrived at the Royal Harem,
Shauno fainted when he saw all the wives the poor Shah had to look
after. It took him two weeks to count them all, and at the end of that
time the Shah ses: &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;how many would
you like to take for a present? You can have all you want, because I am
expecting another shipload next week as a Christmas box.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks for your kind offer,&rsquo; ses Shauno.
&lsquo;But I am cured now. I have made up my mind to go home and live
in peace, and remain a bachelor for the remainder of my
days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the Shah, &lsquo;I think you should at
least take one, and she will help to remind you of your visit to the
Shah of Sperrispazuka.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only too well that I know that, but I have
seen all I ever want to see of women,&rsquo; ses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>Shauno. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what you
can do without offending me, or hurting my tender feeling in any
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What may that be?&rsquo; ses the Shah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can loan me a million sovereigns to show there is
no ill feeling between us, and send me home in one of your first-class
battleships. Of course, I must travel as a private gentleman, and when
I will arrive home, I will get my poet laureate to write an ode to your
generosity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll loan you all you want,&rsquo; ses the
Shah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there and then he took out his bank book and gave him a
cheque for the full amount, and on the morrow Shauno sailed away for
England in one of the swiftest ships that ever went to sea, and the
Shah never heard of him from that day to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the devil&rsquo;s own queer yarn,&rdquo; said
Micus. &ldquo;What did the Shah do when he found out that he had been
fooled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was as cross as a bag of cats, of course, and retired
to the banquet hall of his castle, sent for all his wives, and made
this speech: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ladies of all shapes and sizes,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;I have good news for you this blessed day. I&rsquo;m going to
make widows of every one here present, and all those who couldn&rsquo;t
gain admittance to this large and spacious hall as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they heard what he said, they all burst forth into
uproarious applause, and began to fling chairs, benches, stools,
ink-bottles, and hairpins at each other. In short, they created the
devil of a hullaballoo entirely, and they might have set fire to the
place, only he threatened to send for the police. Well, when silence
and order was restored, he continued and ses:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ladies,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;you will be all glad to
hear that I have been fooled and cheated by an impostor, and as I have
proved conclusively to my own satisfaction that I am too foolish to
live, I have made up my mind to die. Yes, ladies, and to die by my own
hand too. But as many of you as possible must have something to remind
you of married life and a devoted husband who is about to begin his
troubles in the other world by ending his troubles in this. Now,&rsquo;
ses he, &lsquo;come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210"
name="pb210">210</a>]</span>forward, one and all, and let each of you
pluck a hair from my leonine head, and keep it in a locket as a
souvenir until you will go home to the devil, or wherever else you may
be destined for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as the last few words were spoken, he bent down his head,
and his wives came along in single file to comply with his request, and
before an hour was at an end, the Shah of Sperrispazuka was as bald as
a snowball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier for him to get a scissors and
cut his hair and then distribute the locks, than to do anything so
foolish,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisha, I suppose it would,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;But we
all do foolish things when we are upset or excited. Well, when that
part of the ceremony was all over, he ses, as the tears came to his
eyes: &lsquo;Ladies,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I have no more to say. My
hour is come and I am ready to die. I have here with me on this table a
cocktail which is a concoction of ground green bottles, prussic acid,
and black beetles mixed with some cheese that was refused by the
soldiers at the fall of Rome, and if that won&rsquo;t send me to glory
or perdition, may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span>I never again drown one of you in the Canal
for losing your beauty. However,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;as a last
request I would ask you to control your emotion. Let there be no
singing of the National Anthem, no dancing of jigs, drinking or
carousing, breaking of windows or skulls, or any other patriotic
manifestation of public grief, until I am cold in my grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he lifted the fatal glass to his lips and drained
its contents to the dregs, and so passed away the Shah of
Sperrispazuka.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like having a drink of something, myself,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll stop
when we&rsquo;ll come to the Thrush and Magpie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said Micus. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Padna to Micus, as they
wended their way along a lonely road after Mass on a Sunday morning,
&ldquo;if you ever heard tell of the black dog of Dooniskey that was
gifted with seven senses, second sight, and an easy disposition, who
followed my grandfather from the Bridge of the Hundred Arches to the
Half Way House in Cromwell&rsquo;s Glen on the night of the rising of
&lsquo;98. And how he caught a hold of the tail of his coat and dragged
him from Owen Roe&rsquo;s Cross to Cuchulain&rsquo;s Boreen while the
soldiers of England&rsquo;s king were scouring the highways looking for
some one to hang to the nearest finger post. And &rsquo;twas little
they cared about any man, for one man looked as good as another to
them, as he swung from a branch of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>tree on the roadside
or on a gibbet on the mountain top. And &rsquo;twas the selfsame black
dog that saved him from the fairies of Galway on a dark windy night,
when all the fairies of the world assembled in the Gap of Dunlow and
made speeches in favour of women holding their tongues until the
Judgment Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard tell of the black dog of Dooniskey, or your old
grandfather, or the fairies who wanted to steal him either, but what
the fairies wanted him for is more than I can understand,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisha, bad luck to your ignorance this blessed day, not to
know that he was the best musician in the seven parishes, and the likes
of his playing on the fiddle was never known since the Devil played a
jig for Henry the Eighth the night he died. What do you think the
fairies would want my grandfather for, but to play the
&lsquo;Coulin,&rsquo; &lsquo;Eileen Aroon,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Last Rose
of Summer,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Dirge of Ossian,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
Lamentation of Deirdre&rsquo; and &lsquo;My Dark Rosaleen&rsquo; for
them in the caves of the ocean when the drowsy eye of night
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>quivers and closes, and they tired of dancing to
the music of the waves on the cobbled beaches of the north, south,
east, and western coast?&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a great thing indeed to be able to play the
fiddle, sing a song, dance a jig, make a short speech, tell a good
story, or do anything at all that gives pleasure to another, but the
greatest of all achievements is to be able to please yourself without
offending some one else. But be that as it may, let me hear no more
about your grandfather, because there is nothing disagrees with me more
than to have to listen to some one retailing the exploits of people I
haven&rsquo;t the remotest interest in,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you might like to hear about the black cat I met
the night before I got married,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s coming over you at all? If we were to be
noticing the doings of black cats, black dogs, the rats that leave a
ship, the queer dreams that follow a heavy supper, the calm that
precedes and follows a storm, and all the other signs and tokens
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>that may mean everything or nothing, we would
become so bewildered that damn the bit of work would we do from one end
of the year to the other, and by trying to become too wise we would
become too foolish for sensible people to pay any attention to
us,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some men don&rsquo;t realize how foolish they are by being
too sensible, until they see their grandchildren squandering their
hard-earned savings,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of experience that makes pessimists,
and the few people worth working for are, as a rule, able to work for
themselves. And though there is a limit to all things, except the
extravagance of women and the patience of husbands, yet on the other
hand only for women there would be no trouble, and without trouble of
some kind life wouldn&rsquo;t be worth living,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s trouble everywhere, both on the dry land, the
stormy ocean, in the cot and in the castle, and the devil a one will
you ever find who doesn&rsquo;t like to have a quarrel now and again.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>But as the Mayor of Loughlaurna said to me one
day: &lsquo;Life is too short for some, too long for others, and a
great bother to us all,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the devil was the Mayor of Loughlaurna, and where did you
meet him?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mayor of Loughlaurna,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;if I am
to take his own word for it, was a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have to
tell you he&rsquo;s one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither does a bla&rsquo;guard, a thief, or a rogue, for that
matter,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;Howsomever, &rsquo;twas on a
summer&rsquo;s day, many years ago when I was young, and believed all
the things I should doubt, and doubted all I should believe, that I met
the Mayor of Loughlaurna. I was out fishing in a small boat that I had
moored in the centre of the lough itself, and though I started at early
morning, blast the bit did I catch all day except a cold in the head
and chest, but as I was about to haul in my line at the tail end of the
evening, something began to pull and tug, and I hauled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>and
hauled and hauled until I thought I was dragging one of the Spanish
Armada from the depths of the sea. But lo and behold! what did I find,
when I came to the end of my pulling and tugging and dragging, but the
finest-looking salmon your eyes ever rested on. And when I drew him
over the gunwale, and took the hook from his mouth before breaking his
neck on my knee, he gave one jump, cleared two thwarts, stood on his
tail and commenced to abuse me, the same as if he was in politics all
his lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bad scran to your confounded impudence and
presumption, not to say a word about your absence of courtesy and good
breeding,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;How dare you interfere with people who
don&rsquo;t interfere with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;sure &rsquo;tis by
interference, inference, and ignorance that most of us become
prosperous and presumptuous. And without presumption there would be no
assumption, and without assumption there would be only chaos, and
people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>would never get the things they are not entitled
to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I often heard that a
little learning is the saving grace of an ignoramus, but now I have no
doubt whatever about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;if it takes a rogue to find
a rogue, it takes one ignoramus to find wisdom in another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;that you have a lot to
learn, and as much more to unlearn, before you will be fit to advise
those who may be senseless enough to heed you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You should know,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;unless you are a
schoolmaster, that what is wisdom to one man is tomfoolery to another.
But who the blazes are you anyway, that I should be wasting my time
talking like this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You might as well be talking to me as anyone
else,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;because most people spend their lives
between talking and sleeping, and all their old talk makes no more
impression on the world than their snoring. And when they die, they are
immediately forgotten by every one except those <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>to
whom they owed money. But if &rsquo;tis the way you want to know who I
am,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I will tell you before you will have time to
make another mistake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must hurry up then,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The man who stands here before you,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;is no less a person than His Lordship the Mayor of
Loughlaurna.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a giant of a title for a bit of a man
like yourself,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;But how came the likes of you to be
Mayor of Loughlaurna?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What way would any one become mayor of a city, unless
by his ability to control others, or the ability of others to control
him? Many a man got a good job because he knew how to hold his
tongue,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;honesty must have gone on
a holiday the day that gold was discovered, and never
returned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, God help you for a poor fool to think that
honesty ever existed. Honesty is like the gift of silence among
women,&mdash;it only exists, so to speak, after death. But now to my
history. I suppose you often heard tell of a song that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>tinkers sing in public houses on Saturday
nights. It goes like this:</p>
<div class="lgouter xd20e2332">
<p class="line">&rdquo;On Lough Neagh&rsquo;s bank, as the fisherman
strays,</p>
<p class="line xd20e2736">When the clear cool eve&rsquo;s
declining,</p>
<p class="line">He sees the round towers of other days</p>
<p class="line xd20e2736">In the waters beneath him
shining.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed, I did then many and many a
time,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;My mother used to sing it for me when I was
in the cradle, and &lsquo;twill keep ringing in my ears till the day I
die, as &lsquo;twill keep ringing in the ears of every son of
Granuaile, whether he be drinking tea with the dusky maidens of the
South Seas or philandering with the beauties of the United
States.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are the American beauties as contrary as ever?&rsquo;
ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;they can afford to be more
so than women who can&rsquo;t support their husbands. Man at last is
emancipated and is now beginning to take his place side by side with
woman. The age of freedom is at hand and chaos is within arm&rsquo;s
reach,&rsquo; ses I. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"
name="pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That little digression was interesting,&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;But to proceed about the song. My poor mother used to sing it
for me too, and told me the story of how it came to be written. It
appears that in the long, long ago, before people were as satisfied
with their ignorance and bad manners as they are to-day, there was a
well in the town of Neagh that grew to be a great lake in the middle of
the night, and before morning came the highest steeple was covered, and
every single inhabitant, man, woman, and child, was drowned. And only
for that,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;maybe &rsquo;tis the way yourself would
be walking through the streets of the town this very day admiring the
pretty girls, for &rsquo;tis the eye of a philanderer you have, not to
mention your sleuthering tongue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas long ago that I gave up admiring the
pretty girls,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it,&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;A man is never too old to admire a pretty woman. And the old
men, God forgive them, are worse than the young men. For the young ones
does be shy and bashful, while the old ones are as brazen and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>courageous as the Devil himself, even though
they might be on the brink of the grave itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have listened to enough of your old talk, and if you
want me to believe that you are the Mayor of Loughlaurna, you must
prove it. What are you but a fish? And how could a fish be Mayor of a
city?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t always a fish, and I suppose you have
heard of Spain and the Rocky Mountains?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have, of course,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the children of Lir?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, the night before King Lir&rsquo;s lovely
daughter Fionnuala and her two brothers were turned into swans by the
magic power of their stepmother, and condemned to wander on the waters
of the world for three hundred years, I was sitting by my own fireside,
reading about the adventures of Brian Boru, the Red Branch Knights,
Queen Maeve, and Deirdre.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;Brian Boru
wasn&rsquo;t born when King Lir took unto himself a second
wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t interrupt me for a trifle like
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>that, though strictly speaking trifles are the
cause of most interruptions. That&rsquo;s only a historical mistake,
and history itself is full of mistakes. And the man who can&rsquo;t
make a mistake must be a damn fool. However,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;as I
was sitting by the hearth reading away for myself, who should stroll
into the drawing-room but a fairy princess with a wand in her hand? And
as I didn&rsquo;t know who she was or where she came from, I up and
ses: &ldquo;Good night, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; ses I, &ldquo;as you
wouldn&rsquo;t say it yourself.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good night kindly,&rsquo; ses she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Might I ask who are you at all?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I told you who I am, you would be as wise as
myself,&rsquo; ses she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know who you are talking to?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed, I do,&rsquo; ses she. &lsquo;You are Michael
Henry Patrick Joseph Billy Dan MacMorrough, the Mayor of
Laurna.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s my full name and title,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;but I takes more after my mother&rsquo;s people than my
father&rsquo;s.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href=
"#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a pity, because your mother was decent to
the point of folly, while your father never did a bit for any one but
himself,&rsquo; ses she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what may your business be with me this blessed
night?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I just want to amuse myself at your expense,&rsquo;
ses she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why at all?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, just because you are the most respected man in
the land, and have only a good word for every one, and because you have
always done the right thing and lived an exemplary life. In this world
most things go by contrary. The good must suffer so that the bad may
have a chance of enjoying themselves. And as the good are always
worrying about the bad, and as the bad never bother their heads about
the good, and as everything is topsy turvy, &rsquo;tis only right and
consistent that you should be duly punished for your virtues, and made
to know what sorrow means in its widest sense,&rsquo; ses she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you going to do to me?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to turn you into a fish,&rsquo; ses
she. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What kind of a fish? A sprat or a mackerel
maybe?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing so common,&rsquo; ses she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What, then?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A salmon,&rsquo; ses she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank heavens,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;That same is a
consolation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Things are never so bad that a woman can&rsquo;t make
them worse. And things might be much better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Howsomever,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I think that
&rsquo;tis a piece of gross injustice to change me from a respectable
man into a fish, moreover when I am head and ears in love with King
Lir&rsquo;s lovely daughter Fionnuala.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lir&rsquo;s lovely daughter was turned into a swan
last night,&rsquo; ses she. &lsquo;But &rsquo;tis better to have loved
and lost inself than to be kept awake at night by squalling children
who won&rsquo;t thank you when they grow up for all you had to endure
on their account. And who would want to provide for a large wife and a
large family unless he might have plenty money,&rsquo; ses she.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it the truth you are telling about the children of
Lir?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Twill soon be a recorded fact in
history,&rsquo; ses she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as the words fell from her lips, tears fell from his
eyes, and he wept and wept until the water reached his chin, and then
with one wave of the magic wand he was turned into a salmon, but he
still continued to weep and weep until the waters rose above the
highest steeple in the town of Laurna, and there he lived <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e2830" title="Source: swiming">swimming</span> about in
his own tears, until I caught him when fishing for bream on a
summer&rsquo;s evening some five and twenty years ago,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you say to him when he told you that
yarn?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said that I thought he should have been more upset about
his own fate than that of Lir&rsquo;s lovely daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That may be,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;but there&rsquo;s
no pleasure to be got from worrying about yourself. We only really
enjoy ourselves when we fret and worry about those we love. The
pleasures of melancholy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href=
"#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>are best enjoyed by those who have
loved and lost and been desired by no one else. And besides,&rsquo; ses
he, &lsquo;the man who has suffered is always more interesting and
entertaining than the man who has not. But at best that is only cold
comfort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True for you,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;Yet you should have
received your liberty years and years ago, because the children of Lir
were released from their captivity at the dawn of Christianity. The
ringing of the first church bell was the signal for their release, but
when they returned home after their wanderings, all their old friends
and neighbours were dead and gone. Why you should be made suffer so
much, or any of us, the best and the worst, is more than I can
comprehend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The devil a one of me can understand it, either. None
of us know what&rsquo;s before us, because none of us know what may
have been behind us, so to speak. But if I did live before,
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t likely that I was an angel,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;that none of us can
differentiate thoroughly between good and evil. What <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>one
man thinks is right another will think is wrong, and while none of us
understand the other, we can&rsquo;t expect things to be any better
than they are. If we all thought alike, there would be no difference of
opinion. And if we all agreed about religion and politics, we might
have the greatest contempt for each other. And unless a man is either
better or worse than ourselves, we don&rsquo;t pay any attention to him
at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We could keep bladdering away like this till the
leaves fall from the trees, but you have not told me yet when the fairy
princess said you would be released,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When a woman can be found who don&rsquo;t want to get
her photo taken, or see herself in a mirror, or want to read her
husband&rsquo;s letters, or search his pockets, and when the Germans
will get to Paris,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You had better go back to the Lough,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;because I am getting
thirsty as well as homesick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with that he shook hands with me, bid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>me
good-by, and jumped into the waters, and that was the last I saw of the
Mayor of Loughlaurna.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place like home,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Padna. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"

<p class="first"><span class="corr" id="xd20e2875" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Ah, God help us, but &rsquo;tis a bad
night for poor sailors,&rdquo; said Padna Dan, as he pulled his chair
close to the glowing hearth where faggots blazed and a kettle sang.
&ldquo;The strand will be strewn with wreckage to-morrow, and there
will be more widows and lonely mothers in the world than ever there was
before, and all because the winds have no mercy, and the sea has no
mercy, and there&rsquo;s no mercy anywhere but in the heart of God.
There&rsquo;s a peal of thunder now, and if the clouds burst and the
rain comes, there won&rsquo;t be a sheaf of corn left standing in
Castlebawn to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will, please God,&rdquo; said Micus, as he stirred the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis like you to have the good word,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>Padna, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sick and tired of
this country altogether. When we have a fine summer we have a bad
autumn, and when we have a good spring we have a wet summer, and when
we have a hard winter we have nothing at all. I can&rsquo;t understand
these things. &lsquo;Pon my word, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor any one else, either,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;How
is it that decent fathers and mothers rear worthless children, and
worthless children rear decent fathers and mothers? Or how is it that
grass grows in the fields, and the lark sings in the sky, and the trees
lose their leaves in winter? Or how is it that the world isn&rsquo;t
under water long ago after all the rain we&rsquo;ve had since Cromwell
went to hell? Or how is it that people will spend half their lifetime
educating themselves, and then go to war and kill people they had no
quarrel with at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I can&rsquo;t understand these
things?&rdquo; said Padna, rather piqued. &ldquo;Sure if I could,
I&rsquo;d be a philosopher, and if I was a philosopher, I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about anything.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because philosophers are people with easy minds and usually
they have all they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s a pessimist?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pessimist is a philosopher before he gets a good
job,&rdquo; answered Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what am I then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you? You&rsquo;re a philosopher, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedad, I suppose I am,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;It takes all
kinds of people to make a world, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;Philosophers, pessimists,
suffragettes, and policemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is a strange place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is, and a beautiful place, when you haven&rsquo;t
to work for a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And life is a strange thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is a wonderful thing, a queer and bewildering thing, but
a magnificent thing withal, when you&rsquo;re not married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis, but no one makes the most of it. Some make it
short by trying to make it long, and others make it long by trying to
make it short.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href=
"#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Suicide is a cowardly thing if you&rsquo;re married, and a
brave thing if you&rsquo;re not, but there&rsquo;s nothing worse than
selfishness, except being an Orangeman. They&rsquo;re more proud than
the peacocks themselves, and no one would bother with peacocks only for
their fine feathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never ate peacocks,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d
rather a good piece of bacon and cabbage than the finest turkey that
was ever killed, cooked, and eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good green cabbage is a wholesome thing and bacon is better,
but when a man has neither, there&rsquo;s nothing like a good
smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of this country,&rdquo; said Micus.
&ldquo;Some things are better than others, and a little of anything
only gives you an appetite for more, and too much is as bad as too
little. Too little makes one peevish and selfish, and too much makes
one foolish. When you&rsquo;re happy, you start thinking about the days
of sorrow and mourning you had, and when you&rsquo;re unhappy you start
thinking about the days of joy and pleasure, and no matter what way you
are, you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>want to be some other way. Sure this is no place
for a man to live, if he wants to enjoy himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where would you live if not in your native land? The
savage loves his native heath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he does, but the real estate men love it better, and
that&rsquo;s why land is so dear in America. The Land of Peace and
Plenty is the only place to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Land of Peace and Plenty! Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! &rsquo;tis leagues and leagues and leagues from anywhere
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a ship, of course. When I was a boy, I sailed over the
ocean for six months without finding a single night, nothing but days
all the time, until you forgot what darkness was like. Well, one night
at twelve o&rsquo;clock, though &rsquo;twas broad daylight, mind you,
one of our crew, Martin O&rsquo;Farrell, was playing &lsquo;The Boys of
Wexford&rsquo; on a gadget, when lo and behold! a sea serpent puts his
head out of the waters and ses: &lsquo;Bravo, Martin,&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the finest tune <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>in all the world, but
play me a four-hand reel,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;&ldquo;The
Kerryman&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; for choice, and I&rsquo;ll dance for
you until old Ireland is free.&rsquo; And Martin started to play
&lsquo;The Kerryman&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo; and the sea serpent started
to dance, and he kicked up such a devil of a row, and lashed and
splashed the waters until our ship got tossed about so badly that she
finally foundered, and not a soul was saved but myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you save yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when I saw the way things were, I thought to myself
that there was trouble ahead, so I lashed a knife to each of my feet,
and one on each of my hands, the way you&rsquo;d see fins on a fish. I
put three on my back and so many on my head that you&rsquo;d think I
was a porcupine, and when I looked to the west, I saw land about two or
three hundred miles away. &lsquo;Fortune favors the brave as well as
the foolish,&rsquo; ses I, and then I started out for the
shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t, how could I be telling you all about it?
Well, the sea was alive with hungry sharks, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>but
every time one swallowed me up, I cut my way through and escaped, only
to be swallowed again, but even that had its advantages. I was carried
nearer the shore each time, until finally I reached terra firma, as
safe and as sound as a Protestant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many sharks did you kill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just enough to teach the others how to behave
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you reached the shore, what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dried my clothes on the hot sand, shaved myself with one of
the knives I had on my head, and used a pool of water for a looking
glass, and when I combed my hair, every lady in the land fell in love
with me, but I only fell in love with one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what kind was she?&rdquo; asked Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a lady of great beauty,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;and
as she passed by she looked into my eyes, and though I might live for
ten thousand years I will never forget her. Sure no words that ever
were spoken could describe her queenly gait and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>inspiring glances. She seemed to have come from
some place not yet discovered by man, and looked as lonesome and as
beautiful as a lily in a cabbage garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did you not follow her and find out something about
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah me, sure she disappeared for ever, before I could find any
word at all to say. I have seen other beautiful women, but they had
only the beauty of flowers which fade and die. But her beauty was the
beauty which lives and never dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it must be that same thing which all the people
does be talking about, but don&rsquo;t know what it is at all, at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure if you knew all about anything, you wouldn&rsquo;t be
talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is the most beautiful thing in all the world, and it
isn&rsquo;t so much anything else as a divine state of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So &rsquo;twas in the Land of Peace and Plenty that you fell
in love with a beauty who came into your life for a moment and went out
of it for ever?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href=
"#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve remained an old
bachelor, was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one and only reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for you,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be sorry,&rdquo; said Micus. &ldquo;If a
bachelor has sorrows, he has joys as well, and &rsquo;tis better to
keep what you have than to lose what you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you lose what you haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might get it if you tried hard enough, and then
only find discontent and disillusionment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go to the Land of Peace and Plenty. It must
be a wonderful place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful place it is, then, surely, and nearly as
wonderful as the sun itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the earth goes too near the sun it is too hot, and when
it goes too far away from the sun it is too cold, but in the Land of
Peace and Plenty, I suppose it must be always beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed and it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do all the people do there?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Land of Peace and Plenty, nobody does anything but
enjoy themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the Land of Peace and Plenty is such a wonderful
place, how is it that the great powers of the world don&rsquo;t go to
war for it?&rdquo; asked Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they did go to war for it long before you began to make
mistakes,&rdquo; answered Micus, &ldquo;and great battles were fought
there too. And after the greatest battle of all was ended, the King ses
to all the High Generals: &lsquo;Fellow warriors and likewise
courageous omadhauns,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;what are we fighting for,
anyway? The world is large enough for us all, and there&rsquo;s enough
of dead men already, and those that aren&rsquo;t dead are alive, and
those that are alive are nearly dead, but all the same,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;I must compliment you on the magnificent way you slaughtered my
fellow countrymen and your own fellow men, though why you did so, or
wanted to do so, God alone knows.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every man is entitled to as much enjoyment as he can
afford,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;Sorrow is the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>price of pleasure, and the sport of nations is
the curse of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t discuss international politics. The world was
best when people left others to mind their own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceed about the King of the Land of Peace and
Plenty,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;Interruptions and digressions are bad
unless they&rsquo;re for one&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but half a loaf is better than no bread
when a man isn&rsquo;t hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two heads are better than one,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;and
two fools, if they are any way sensible at all, are better than a wife
with a bad temper. But comparisons are odious, as the whale said to the
grasshopper. Go on with your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the King ses to the Generals, after they had all
forgotten what he first started talking about: &lsquo;I demand,&rsquo;
ses he, &lsquo;in the name of justice, common sense, and humanity, that
we will be allowed time to bury our dead, and that there will be no
thunderous cannonading of artillery, no charges of cavalry, infantry,
nor anything else that might be a breach of the etiquette of war,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>until our last man is buried.&rsquo; And then
and there the Generals agreed, and from that day to this, there was
never a sound, except of music, heard in the Land of Peace and
Plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see, when the
last man was buried, some one else died, and as there will be always
some one dying, there will be always some one to be buried in the Land
of Peace and Plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the water is boiled out of the kettle,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty more in the well,&rdquo; said Micus.

"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>What&rsquo;s troubling you at all?
You&rsquo;re not looking yourself to-day,&rdquo; said Padna Dan to his
friend Micus Pat, as he cut a switch from a blackthorn tree on the road
to Mallow on a May morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a thing that troubles a man that he
doesn&rsquo;t like to talk about,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;and many a
thing that he talks about that doesn&rsquo;t trouble him at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some one died who owed you money,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as you seem to be anxious to know, it was the way that
some one died, but the devil a ha&rsquo;penny did he owe me, no more
than yourself or the Pope of Rome,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he a member of the Royal Family then, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>or
some one born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and no more brains in
his head than you&rsquo;d find with a sparrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was no way connected with royalty or the aristocracy, but
a decent man who always worked for a living, one Lareen, the
birdcatcher from Duhallow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the use fretting about any one who is dead
and gone? Sure we must all die, and maybe there will be no one fretting
about ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some truth in that, but we can&rsquo;t always be as
philosophic as we pretend to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was Lareen of such importance that you can&rsquo;t forget
him, now that he&rsquo;s gone to his reward or his deserts, as the case
may be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;Lareen was a Murphy on his
father&rsquo;s side and a Cassidy on his mother&rsquo;s, and both
families were noted the world over for their love of sport, black
pudding, and fresh drisheens. And Lareen, like his father and
grandfather, was a birdcatcher by nature and a shoemaker by profession,
and he always made boots and shoes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"
href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>for the parish priest and the
minister, and he used to collect the money at the chapel door on
Sundays. There was no man in the seven parishes who could blow the
organ for vespers better than himself, but the devil a bit he ever got
for all he did for others, except that he contracted rheumatics from
walking in the rain while attending funerals of the poor. However, that
same had its compensations, because it helped him to remember that he
wasn&rsquo;t long for this life, and that he had a soul to save and a
wife and family to support. But to go on with my story. One fine
morning, as I was reading the newspaper that I got the lend of from the
public house opposite the pump at the bend of the road, who should come
into the house but Lareen himself, and there and then he up and ses:
&lsquo;Good morning, Micus,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good morning kindly, Lareen,&rsquo; ses I.
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good word?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing in particular,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you no news at all?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I have a little,&rsquo; ses he. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear it then,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;The King of Morocco
has a corn on his big toe, and he sent to the United States for a
specialist to remove it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that so?&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;Sure &lsquo;twould be
as cheap to send to London or Dublin or Cork itself for a specialist as
the United States,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;An operation like that will
cost him a lot of money, anyway, but what matter? He don&rsquo;t have
to earn it, and the more he spends, the more respectable the people
will think he is. But nevertheless &lsquo;twould be cheaper for him to
cut a piece out of his boot, or cut his toe off altogether, than to
send to America for a doctor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and if we were all to
charge as much for the little we do as the doctors and the specialists,
&rsquo;tis the way that we might make bankrupts of each other
overnight, and as a consequence we might all die of want and
privation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very true indeed, but is that all the
news you have for me?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, not exactly,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;There was a
man shot in Russia last week, the Grand Duke <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>of
Ballybrophy went to America to be lionized by the republicans and
democrats, a kangaroo died in Australia, the King of Italy bought a new
hat, and Queen Victoria gave a shilling for the relief of the poor of
Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And tell me,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;is it all to be
given to the Protestants?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis to be equally
divided among the poor of all classes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rsquo; ses I,
&lsquo;because it denotes a fine, broad-minded, and generous spirit.
But what pleases me more than anything else is that she has not
forgotten that Ireland is still on the map.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;Ireland will never be
forgotten while there is money to be made at politics in America, and
politics, they say, is the most popular religion in the United
States.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And was it to tell me what I know already that brought
you here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;I wanted to tell you that I
dreamt of my mother&rsquo;s people last night, and that always brings
me good luck. So as &rsquo;tis a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247"
href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>fine hard frosty day,
I&rsquo;d like to go birdcatching in Fingal&rsquo;s Glen, and catch a
dozen linnets, half a dozen finches, and maybe a couple of blackbirds
and thrushes. But I haven&rsquo;t the makings of a sprig of birdlime,
or a crib, or a good singing bird to bring with me,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If that is all that&rsquo;s troubling you,&rsquo; ses
I, &lsquo;you have no longer any cause to worry. I&rsquo;ll give you
the box of birdlime that the bishop himself made me a present of last
Easter, and I&rsquo;ll give you the loan of the best singing bird I
have in the house, a linnet that would put a nightingale or a prima
donna to shame,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with that I handed him the box of birdlime that was made
by the best cobbler in Antrim, and I took down the linnet cage from
over the half door, and gave him that also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then ses I, &lsquo;Go your way and may God bless you, and
if you can&rsquo;t catch birds with my linnet and the bishop&rsquo;s
birdlime, you might as well go to America and try and convince the
Irish-Americans that they are not a bit better than the Irish at
home.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisha, bad luck to their impudence,&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;What do they know about the Irish at home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The devil a hap&rsquo;orth,&rsquo; ses I. And then he
put the cage under his arm and ses: &lsquo;I wish I knew how to thank
you for all your kindness, and now I will trouble you for the loan of
your topcoat, the fillings of a pipe, and a box of matches. For
&rsquo;tis frozen with the cold I&rsquo;ll be, standing behind a furze
bush waiting for a flock of linnets to rise, so that I may throw myself
down on my face and hands on the wet grass, the way they wouldn&rsquo;t
see me at all,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A good birdcatcher,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;will always
find a place where he will be able to hide without throwing himself
down on the wet grass or soft earth. However, you are welcome to the
loan of my old coat, and I will make you a present of a plug of tobacco
and a box of matches.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So after he put on the coat, he walked away with his
&lsquo;May the Lord spare and protect you all the days of your
life,&rsquo; and a week passed before he returned. I was eating my
breakfast when he called, and as he pushed open the half <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>door
with his &lsquo;God bless all here,&rsquo; I up and ses: &lsquo;What
luck?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about luck,&rsquo; ses he, as
he placed the overcoat, the box of birdlime, and the cage on a chair
beside him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the happiest man alive,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why, might I ask?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis only selfish
people who can be really happy. Howsomever, let me hear what you have
to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I caught a linnet with a crown of gold,&rsquo; ses
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You did!&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I did,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There must be a finch or a canary in the family
then,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe both,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How does he sing?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sing!&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;Why, he never stops
singing at all, only when the twilight fades and the darkness comes
from east and west, and north and south, and the blackness of the night
covers up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>the hills and the valleys, the trees and the
rivers, and the streams and the houses themselves,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He must be a wonder,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A wonder he is surely,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;He starts
at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning and sings all day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s so,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be
outside your door with my ear to the keyhole at quarter to five, so
that I can&rsquo;t miss the first note to break the silence and tell us
that day is come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And herself is going to stay up all night, lest she
might miss even the flutter of his wings, when he wakes from his
sleep,&rsquo; ses Lareen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when the morrow came, I was at Lareen&rsquo;s door at
the peep o&rsquo; day, listening to the sweetest music that was ever
heard in town or city, in lonely glen or by the cobbled seashore when
the storm does be raging and huge breakers dash themselves to pieces on
the treacherous rocks. Wonderful indeed was the song of the linnet with
the crown of gold, and musicians came from all parts of the world to
hear him, and all listened with great attention and took down in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>a book each note as he uttered it. And when they
returned home, they made operas, oratorios, and symphonies from the
melodies they heard in Lareen&rsquo;s kitchen. And selections were made
for the violin, &lsquo;cello, and organ, and played at classical
concerts where the well-fed fashionable people, who have no more love
for art or music than a tinker&rsquo;s donkey, pay for being bored to
death. And thus it was that the fame of Lareen&rsquo;s linnet grew
until the King of Spain heard all about him, and immediately he sailed
away from the shores of his native country with more money in his
pocket than all the kings of Europe could earn in ten thousand years.
And when, after a weary journey, he found himself seated by the fire
talking to Lareen, all of a sudden he up and ses: &lsquo;Lareen,&rsquo;
ses he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a golden guinea for every mistake
you have made since you came to the use of reason, if you will give me
the linnet with the crown of gold,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And did you accept his offer?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I did not,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You damn fool,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;Sure, if you only
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>got a half sovereign inself for every mistake
you made since you were born, you would have been made a millionaire on
the spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And how do you know I have made so many
mistakes?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, you omadhaun,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
you know as yet that nearly everything we do is some kind of a mistake
or other, but we don&rsquo;t know it until we are told so by some one
else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;And I am just as well
pleased that I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what did the king say when he heard your
refusal?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took out his handkerchief and began to cry, and then ses
he: &lsquo;I will give you your choice of a wife, and I will give you
your own way as long as you can stand it, if you will give me the
linnet, and I will make you a Knight of the Spade and Turnip
besides.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you kindly,&rsquo; ses Lareen. &lsquo;But, not
for all the women that ever made fools of their husbands would I part
with the linnet with the crown of gold.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;So the king sailed away that night with sadness in his heart
and tears in his eyes, and &rsquo;twas said that he was never heard
whistling anything till the day he died but the song of the linnet with
the crown of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the King of Prussia came and ses to Lareen:
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a great war one day,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;and if you will give me the linnet with the golden crown, I will
give you half of France, the whole of Belgium, and maybe the Tower of
London as well, when the war is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t count your chickens before they are
hatched,&rsquo; ses Lareen, &lsquo;and remember the gentleman who went
to live on St. Helena after the battle of Waterloo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, the spalpeen!&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;He was bound
to be caught anyway, because he overestimated his own
importance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just like a good many more people who don&rsquo;t know
it,&rsquo; ses Lareen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So you won&rsquo;t give me the linnet?&rsquo; ses the
king. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; ses Lareen. And with that the king shook
his head and went his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next to come was the King of Japan. And he up and ses:
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s going to be great ructions on the other side of
the Atlantic another day, and if you will give me the linnet with the
golden crown, I will give you your choice of New York or Boston when
the war is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And how are you going to land an army, might I
ask?&rsquo; ses Lareen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With the aid of the navy,&rsquo; ses the king, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bedad, I wonder if that ever occurred to
America,&rsquo; ses Lareen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and what&rsquo;s more, I
don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; ses the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s too much old talk about peace, I&rsquo;m
thinking,&rsquo; ses Lareen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rsquo; ses the king. &lsquo;And talk
by itself never did anything. Why, man alive, there is no such thing as
peace in the world. The very people who advocate peace are always at
cross-purposes with some one else. Sure every thing that&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>alive fights, from the fish in the sea to the
birds of the air, and those who are not prepared always gets the worst
of it. A man with a gun is better than a man with a blackthorn stick in
his fist at any time, even though he might be an Irishman
inself,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And a small dog often leathered the devil out of a
large dog when he caught him unawares,&rsquo; ses Lareen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking sense,&rsquo; ses the King.
&lsquo;And &rsquo;tis only after a fight that you can tell who is the
better man. Life itself is a fight from beginning to end, and when we
cease fighting, well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the end of us.
But be all that as it may, what about giving me the linnet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t part with him,&rsquo; ses Lareen,
&lsquo;for all the money in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses the King, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis a great
pity that you don&rsquo;t know you are so foolish.&rsquo; And with that
he put on his hat, curled his moustache, and walked out the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And every day brought some mighty monarch or other to
Lareen&rsquo;s cottage, and each and every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>one
tried their very best to persuade him to part with the linnet, but they
all went as they came, because Lareen was determined that he would
never part with him until the day of his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened in the end?&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, after the King of the Ballyallen Islands came and
offered all his wealth and possessions for the loan of the linnet to
entertain some of his wife&rsquo;s people at the Royal Palace during
the Christmas holidays, a large grey cat from the police
sergeant&rsquo;s house across the road tumbled the cage from the wall,
opened the door, and golloped up the linnet, with less ceremony than if
he was a mouse or a cockroach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lareen killed the cat and made a fur cap with its skin and
sent it to the Czar of Russia to remind him to be kind to the poor
musicians, because there&rsquo;s nothing finer in the country than its
music, except its literature, of course,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lareen was a fool not to sell the linnet when he got the
first good offer. Any man who leaves <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>opportunity slip
between his fingers, so to speak, is a fool, and the man who
doesn&rsquo;t know what he likes is the greatest fool of all.
&lsquo;Pon my word, I don&rsquo;t know what to think of half the people
I hear about,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I, but while the song of a bird and a sense of
duty means more for some than either money or glory, there&rsquo;s hope
for the world,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedad, I don&rsquo;t doubt but there is,&rdquo; said Padna.

<p class="first"><span class="corr" id="xd20e3252" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>A man who loves nature and lives near the
country need never be lonesome,&rdquo; said Micus Pat to his friend
Padna Dan, as they strolled along a mountain road near the southwestern
coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;And if a
man owes a lot of money, he has the consolation of knowing that he will
not easily be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like every other man of poetic temperament, I think more
about the glories of nature, for they are both inspiring and
incomprehensible, than about what I owe, or the people who were good
enough to oblige me with the loan of money,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis real decent of you to say so, and you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>such
a judge of everything but your own idiosyncrasies,&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look around and about you,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;from the
north to the south, and from the east to the west, and from the west
again back to the east, and from the south again to the north, and if
you are not impressed with the wonder and grandeur with which you are
surrounded, you might as well give up your life to reading the
newspapers and talking politics at the street corners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty confronts us at every turn. The saffron moon peeps
through the vista of pines on the distant hills, the sky is all ablaze
with twinkling stars, and not a sound is heard except that of my own
voice, and the creak of a toad in the rushes,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hear, or I seem to hear,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;the
rippling of a brook as it joins the Owenacurra on its way to the sea,
and it is the sweetest of all music, because it is of nature&rsquo;s
own making, and more soothing to a troubled mind or a weary spirit than
all the melodies made by man.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear no sound but my own voice,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your ear to the ground, and if you are not deaf you will
hear the maddening rush of the brook and the low murmuring of the
Owenacurra and the heart of the world itself beating,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, then,&rdquo; said Padna, as he put his ear to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;do you hear
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the pulse of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis wonderful, surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure &rsquo;tis myself always loves to walk alone by the
seashore when the world does be sleeping, and listen to the melancholy
cry of the sea lark and the curlew, and the soft splash of the waves
against the boulders on the beach on a dark night without any light at
all, except maybe the flash from the lightship, or the glow from the
binnacle lamp of some passing vessel, and she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>sailing over the seas with a cargo of groundsel
for the Emperor of Japan&rsquo;s linnets. There&rsquo;s an eeriness
about the night that creates an atmosphere of poetry and mystery, the
like of which we never experience in the most glorious sunshine, even
when we might be in love itself, and listening to the silvery speech of
the most beautiful woman in all the land,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man is listening to the silvery speech of some lovely
woman, he never knows how expensive &rsquo;tis going to be for him
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silvery speech of women is a magnificent thing, but their
golden silence is a more magnificent thing still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true indeed, but let us forget all about the
contrary creatures for a little while, and I will tell you a story that
the Emperor of Russia would give his two thumbs and two little fingers
to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is it all about?&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the story of a man with a wooden leg,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin,&rdquo; said Padna. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Micus, as he filled his pipe, &ldquo;as I
was sauntering home the other night, I dropped into the Half Way House
to get a toothful of something to keep out the cold, when lo and
behold! who should come in and flop down beside me but a one-legged
sailor and he minus an eye as well, and no more hair on his head than
you&rsquo;d find on a yellow turnip. He was the first to speak, and he
up and ses: &lsquo;Good night, stranger,&rsquo; ses he, as he poked the
fire with his wooden leg, and lit his pipe with a piece of his old
straw hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good night kindly,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a cold kind of night,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The devil of a cold night entirely,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis indeed,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and a bad
night for a poor man who has neither friends nor relations, or one to
bother their heads about him, or even the price of a drink
inself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If &rsquo;tis a drink you want,&rsquo; ses I,
&lsquo;all you have to do is to call for it, and I will pay. What will
you have?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take all I can get for nothing, and give as
little as I can help in return. I&rsquo;m a capitalist <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>by
temperament, but poor because I didn&rsquo;t get a chance of exercising
my talents,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t say no to a glass of
whiskey,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d say no to nothing except a black eye,&rsquo;
ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t afford to have an eye blackened,
when you have only one good eye already,&rsquo; ses I. And then and
there I treated him to two glasses of whiskey, and when he had them
swallowed, I up and ses: &lsquo;How did you lose your lamp?&rsquo;
meaning his eye, of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In a duel with the King of Spain,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Glory be to the Lord!&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;All over a
woman, I presume?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; ses he. And then the salt tears
flowed down his sunken cheeks and formed a pool on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;was she a very handsome
woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She was the most beautiful woman in all the
world,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;except my seventh wife, who was more
beautiful than Venus, herself.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what happened to your seventh wife?&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, she was too fond of her own people, and they got
her to do all their washing and scrubbing, and never gave her a
moment&rsquo;s rest until they killed her with hard work. And then the
devil blast the one of them came to the funeral, and &rsquo;twas
strangers that lowered her into the grave, and no one but myself and
the clergyman said a prayer for the repose of her soul,&rsquo; ses
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She was too good to be remembered, I suppose,&rsquo;
ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She was, God help us,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;But my
ninth wife wasn&rsquo;t either a Venus or a Helen of Troy. She was so
ugly that one day when we were going over a bridge, the river stopped,
and didn&rsquo;t begin to flow again until she left the
town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You had a lot of wives,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I had a few, but &rsquo;tis a mistake to marry
more than ten or twelve times,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when I saw that his grief was getting the better of
him, I ses: &lsquo;Let us not talk any <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>more about your eye,
but tell me how you lost your leg, and I&rsquo;ll give you another
glass of grog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never told that story to any one for less than three
glasses of grog and a small bottle of rum to bring home with me for the
morning, except one time I told it to the Shah of Persia for nothing,
when he promised me the hand of his favourite daughter in
marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me the story, whatever &lsquo;twill cost,&rsquo;
ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; ses he. And then he moved closer to
the fire, and this is what he told:</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was a cold and stormy night in the long long ago.
The thunder rolled and the lightning flashed and the rain fell down in
torrents. I was aboard ship in the middle of the ocean; the stars and
moon were screened and not a light was seen except a glimmer from the
port side of another vessel labouring in the storm. Peal after peal of
thunder resounded until one thought that the gods of war on all the
other planets had gone mad, and were discharging their heavy artillery
at the earth, trying to shatter it to atoms. The canvas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>was
torn from the yards, and spar after spar fell, until nothing but the
masts remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And as the storm grew in intensity, the ship lurched
and the masts themselves fell, and crashed through her as though she
was only made of matchwood; and in their fall they killed as many as
five and twenty men at a time. And as the last mast made splinters of
the deck house, the good ship <i>Nora Crena</i> sank beneath the waves
never to rise again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not a soul was saved but myself, and in those days I
was a great swimmer, and I swam and swam until I found a piece of
floating wreckage, and clung to it the way you&rsquo;d see a barnacle
clinging to the rocks. I remained that way for three days and three
nights, without a bit to eat or anything to read, and nothing to drink
but salt water. And sure I need not tell you that the more you&rsquo;d
drink of that, the more thirsty you&rsquo;d become.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, at the end of the third night, I was cast up on
a little bit of a rock no larger than a stepmother&rsquo;s supper, and
while I was wondering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href=
"#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>how I could get a bit to eat or
reach the shore in safety, a large fish about the size of a shark, but
much more refined and respectable looking, came up from the depths of
the sea, and as he came ashore and sat beside me, he up and ses:
&ldquo;God bless all here,&rdquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;And you too,&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;How are you feeling to-day?&rdquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;A good deal worse than yesterday,&rdquo; ses I.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see, you foolish omadhaun, that I am all
dripping wet from being saturated in the waters of the briny deep, for
this last three days and nights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing at all,&rdquo; ses he.
&ldquo;How would you like to be dripping wet like myself for twenty
years or more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Are you as old as all that?&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Every day of it, if not more. My poor mother,
God help her, had all our birthdays written down in a book, and she had
us all called after the saints of America. Originality was a weakness
with her, but now she&rsquo;s dead and gone, more&rsquo;s the
pity!&rdquo; ses he. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268"
name="pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;What did she die of?&rdquo; ses I. &ldquo;Too
much old talk, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t die a natural death at all,
but was caught in a net and sold to a fishmonger, the same as everyone
belonging to me, both young and old, and the list includes aunts and
uncles, first and second cousins, fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law,
and they the first blight on a man&rsquo;s happiness. And here I am
now,&rdquo; ses he, &ldquo;and I a poor orphan and the last of my name
and race.&rdquo; And then the tears began to come to his eyes, and when
he had stopped weeping he up and ses: &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; ses
he, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m a misanthrope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit surprised at that,&rdquo;
ses I, &ldquo;if, as you say, all belonging to you were
philanthropists, and gave up their lives for the sustenance and
maintenance of the people in the great world beyond. Indiscriminate
philanthropy like that would make a pessimist of any one. Howsomever,
things might be better or worse. You might have been caught in a net
yourself, and sold to a family of tinkers, and I&rsquo;m sure all your
relations wouldn&rsquo;t <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>bother their heads about you, or
care whether you were boiled or fried. They would logically conclude
that as they were so numerous, they could afford to lose at least one
of the family,&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;About that I haven&rsquo;t the remotest
doubt,&rdquo; ses he. &ldquo;But what I can&rsquo;t understand is why
some women will marry their husbands so that they can help their own
sisters&rsquo; or brothers&rsquo; children, as the case may
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; ses I, &ldquo;once women arrive at
the age of indiscretion, there&rsquo;s no use trying to understand
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; ses he, &ldquo;the great
trouble with women, I&rsquo;m thinking, is that they don&rsquo;t
understand themselves or any one else, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Be all that and more as it may,&rdquo; ses I,
&ldquo;even the most foolish women are well able to look after
themselves. But old talk like this would never get me home. And unless
you will take me on your back and swim with me to the shore, &rsquo;tis
the way I&rsquo;ll be after dying both from cold and starvation.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;There was many a better man died from
hunger,&rdquo; ses he. &ldquo;And better men have died from believing
all their wives told them. Howsomever, I will take you to the shore on
one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;And what may that be?&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; ses he, &ldquo;you must promise
that you will never again taste a piece of fish while you
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s an easy matter,&rdquo; says
I. &ldquo;Sure, of course, I&rsquo;ll promise you that much, or as much
more if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like a coward,&rdquo; ses he.
&ldquo;A coward would promise anything to save his skin, and make a
promise as quickly as he&rsquo;d break one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see for the life of me why you
won&rsquo;t take the word of a decent man,&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Wisha, who told you that you were
decent?&rdquo; ses he. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I see and tell what you are
by the shifty look in your eye. To be candid, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust
you as far as I&rsquo;d throw you, and you with two ferrety eyes, and
they so close together that only a rogue, a thief, a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>bla&rsquo;guard, or a bully could own them, and
one of them blind at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;If you only knew how I lost that winker,&rdquo;
ses I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis the way you&rsquo;d be taking off your hat to
me, and shaking hands with yourself for having met the likes of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; ses he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
no limit to the conceit of some and the ignorance of others. I have
eaten my dinner off men and women too, that wouldn&rsquo;t recognise
you at a dog fight. There was the King of Himyumhama and his royal
daughters, for instance, who were drowned in the Skidderymackthomas.
And there were two American millionaires besides, and they as tender
and as nourishing as a boiled chicken or a porterhouse
steak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I bet you,&rdquo; ses I, &ldquo;that you never
ate Irish stew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;And who the devil would want to eat Irish stew
but the Chinese? Sure the Irish themselves never eat it.
However,&rdquo; ses he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use trying to convince
me against my will. I&rsquo;m a man of fixed ideas, and people with
fixed ideas <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>are nearly as impossible as women. Nevertheless,
I suppose you are anxious to get to the shore, and for that I
don&rsquo;t blame you. Like us all, you carry your character in your
face, and I won&rsquo;t lose much by parting company with you.
I&rsquo;m sorry all the same that you haven&rsquo;t an honest
countenance, because a face like yours would do you no more good among
decent people than letters of introduction in the United States of
America, and they are no more use to any one than the measles or the
whooping cough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; ses I, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
think you are talking too much and doing too little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;That may be. Sure, my poor father always told
me I&rsquo;d make a good politician. Howsomever, sit up on my back, and
I&rsquo;ll bring you safe and sound to the shore.&rdquo; And without
waiting to say as much as thank you, or anything else, I jumped on his
back, and he swam for a few hundred yards, but, lo and behold you! all
of a sudden he stopped and turned around to me and ses: &ldquo;Do you
know what?&rdquo; ses he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m losing confidence in
you.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Indeed, then, is that so?&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, it is then,&rdquo; ses he, &ldquo;and the
little bit of respect I had for you in the beginning is nearly all
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Is there any way by which I can inspire
confidence in you, at all?&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there is,&rdquo; ses he.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a patriot and want to do something for the race,
besides making speeches about the achievements of my ancestors and
getting well paid for my pains, and getting all my children and
relations good jobs as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;And what is it you want to do, at all?&rdquo;
ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I want to make sure,&rdquo; ses he, &ldquo;that
you will keep your promise never to eat fish again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I will keep my promise,&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it,&rdquo; ses
he. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody forgotten sooner than a good friend.
But I&rsquo;ll make sure that you will remember me, as the traveling
salesman said to the landlady, when he ran away without paying for his
board and lodging.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true,&rdquo; ses I, &ldquo;that we
forget our friends when they cease to be an advantage to us, and
equally true that we lose respect for our enemies when they cease to
torment and persecute us, but all the same I can&rsquo;t see why you
won&rsquo;t finish your job, considering the good start you have
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I never pay any attention to flattery,&rdquo;
ses he. &ldquo;But whist. I have an idea! I suppose you often heard
tell of the law of compensation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Many and many a time,&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;All right then!&rdquo; ses he. &ldquo;You know,
of course, that we must pay a price for everything we get in this life,
and some, they say, pay in the other world as well. That being so, then
you must pay for your passage to the shore. And as I haven&rsquo;t had
my breakfast yet, I think you couldn&rsquo;t do better than forfeit one
of your legs, and in that way you would serve the double purpose of
paying for your journey and helping me to appease the pangs of hunger.
And, besides, you will be sure to remember me, and &rsquo;tis a matter
for yourself whether you will keep your promise or not.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>And then and there he did a double somersault,
and I fell into the water, and before I had realized what had happened,
my leg was bitten off. And while I tried to keep myself afloat by
hanging on to some seaweed, he up and ses: &ldquo;Bedad,&rdquo; ses he,
&ldquo;that was the nicest meal I had for many a long day. And I think
now that I like the Irish better than the French, Germans, Scotch,
Americans, or the Australians, and I have tasted them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;How do you like the English?&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about the
English,&rdquo; ses he, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t taste one of them if I
had to go hungry for ever, for the stupid way they treated the
Irish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;God knows then, in a way, I wouldn&rsquo;t
blame you. But &rsquo;tis a queer thing for you to leave me here to
drown when you could carry me safely to the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Tell me, are you a Protestant?&rdquo; ses
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I am, God forgive me,&rdquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; ses I. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think I can carry you to
the shore at all now,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; ses I. &ldquo;Sure all
the Protestants are fine, decent, respectable people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;They think they are,&rdquo; ses he. &ldquo;But
who&rsquo;s to know whether they are or not? The Protestants would eat
fish every day of the week, if they could get it, but the Catholics
will only eat it on Fridays, and wouldn&rsquo;t eat it then if they
could help it. And moreover, the Protestants have all the good jobs in
Ireland and the United States, but for choice, &rsquo;tis a Freemason
I&rsquo;d be myself, if I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the question at all,&rdquo;
ses I. &ldquo;Are you, or are you not, going to bring me to the
shore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m about sick and tired of you
now, anyway,&rdquo; ses he, &ldquo;so sit up on my back, and I&rsquo;ll
land you at the Old Head of Kinsale.&rdquo; And sure enough he kept his
word, and I was landed high and dry on the rocks of my native parish in
less time than you&rsquo;d take to lace your shoe. And all he said as
he went his way was: &ldquo;Good-by, now, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>and don&rsquo;t
forget all I told you. I have an invitation to lunch at the Canary
Islands, and I&rsquo;ll be late if I don&rsquo;t hurry.&rdquo; And with
that, he plunged beneath a breaker, and that was the last I ever saw of
the fish who ate my leg off, and made me a cripple for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And did you keep your promise?&rsquo; ses I to the man
with the wooden leg, when he had finished his story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; ses the man with the wooden leg, &lsquo;but
instead, I swore ten thousand holy oaths that I would eat nothing but
fish, if I lived to be as old as Batty Hayes&rsquo;s old goat. And
that&rsquo;s why I am always so thirsty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedad, but that&rsquo;s a queer story, surely,&rdquo; said
Padna. &ldquo;I suppose the fish would have eaten his other leg off,
only it might spoil his appetite for lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe I could beat that for a
yarn,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t try, if I were you,&rdquo; said Micus.

<h2 class="main">The Hermit of the Grove</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;What do you think of the weather?&rdquo; said
Padna Dan to Micus Pat, as he leaned over the half-door, and looked up
at the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Micus, as he struck a match on the heel of
his shoe, &ldquo;I think we will have a fine day, that&rsquo;s if it
don&rsquo;t either rain or snow. And snow and rain inself is better
than a drought, that would parch the whole countryside, and bleach
every blade of grass in the fields as white as linen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two things in life you can never depend on,&rdquo; said
Padna, &ldquo;are women and the weather. But as the hermit of
Deirdre&rsquo;s Grove said to me the other day, when I happened upon
him as he was strolling about looking for something he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>never lost: &lsquo;Every season,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;has its own particular charm, and we all have our faults as well
as our virtues.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what kind of a man was he at all, to be looking for
something he never lost?&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a man just like one of ourselves. Sure that&rsquo;s
what we all do, from the day we open our eyes until we close them again
upon the world,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew that there was a hermit in Deirdre&rsquo;s
Grove,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;until one day last
week when I went looking for hazel-nuts for the grandchildren, and I
came upon a man of strange appearance, and he with long flowing beard,
dark black curly hair, and a physique surpassing anything I have seen
for many a day. His general demeanour was very impressive indeed, and a
kindly look lit up his well-chiseled face. As I approached him, I
wondered what manner of man he was, but he was first to break the
silence. And what he said was: &lsquo;Good morrow, stranger,&rsquo; ses
he. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good morrow and good luck,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May the blessing of God be with you,&rsquo; ses
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May the blessing of God be with us all,&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Amen to that,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Amen, amen!&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Would you mind telling me what day of the year is it,
and what year of the century is it, if you please?&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can easily tell you that,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;but I
couldn&rsquo;t tell you the time of day if you were to make me as gay
as a sprite, as blithe as a lark, and as nimble and fresh as a hare in
the month of March. This is St. Crispin&rsquo;s Day,&rsquo; ses I,
&lsquo;and every shoemaker in Christendom who knows how to enjoy
himself will be as drunk as a lord before the sun goes down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t blame them for getting drunk,&rsquo;
ses he, &lsquo;for hammering on the sole of a shoe from daylight to
dark is no way for a man to enjoy himself. But now,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;if you want to know the time of day, I can tell you that.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course, I&rsquo;d like to know the time of
day,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;come along.&rsquo;
And then we walked to a sun-splashed glade, and he looked up at the sun
itself, and turned to me, and ses, with the greatest gentleness:
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis just a quarter to twelve,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a wonderful clock you have,&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the most wonderful clock in all the world,
and never once ran down since it was set a-going long ago before Adam
was a boy,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t every one can tell you the
time of day by it,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;And
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t every one who can tell you all the other things
they should know, and &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t every one who can forget all
the things not worth remembering,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;and if we
could only remember all that is good for us, and forget all that is bad
for us, we needn&rsquo;t go to any one for advice. But we either
remember too much, or forget too much, and that&rsquo;s why there is so
much discontent and trouble everywhere. However, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>be
that as it may, I&rsquo;d like to know how you manage to enjoy yourself
in this eerie place without any one to keep you company,&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want company,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;because I came here to get rid of myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you a married man?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I escaped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a strange state of affairs,&rsquo; ses I.
&lsquo;Sure I always thought that the only way a man could get rid of
himself was to get lost, so to speak, in the highways and byways of
matrimony, and that he would be so busy trying to please his wife and
children that he wouldn&rsquo;t have any time to think of
himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are more ways of killing a dog than by making
him commit suicide,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;And there are
more ways of getting drunk than paying for what you drink. And many a
man can&rsquo;t feel natural at all, until he is so blind drunk that he
don&rsquo;t know what he does be saying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and a man might live
without working if he could get any one to support him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>But
no matter what happens, time and the world rolls by as indifferently as
though there was nothing worth bothering about. And after all,&rsquo;
ses he, &lsquo;what is the world but a whirling mass of
inconsistencies, and everything changes but man. He has no more sense
now than ever he had. And more&rsquo;s the pity, for women are as
deceitful as ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me how you succeeded in
getting rid of yourself?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I only got rid of myself,
in a measure, of course, by escaping from the thralls of convention,
and coming to live the life of a recluse in this shady and lonely
grove. And while I am here, &rsquo;tis consoling to know that I cannot
injure anybody by doing them good turns, nor can I be of any assistance
to them by being their enemies. A decent enemy,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;oftentimes is worth ten thousand friends, who would only do you
a kindness for the sake of talking about it afterwards. But the best
and most charitable way to behave towards those who try to injure you
is to treat them one and all with silent <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>contempt. That will
hurt them more than anything else. The tongue may cut like a scissors,
but silence gives the deepest wound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That was well spoken for a lonely man,&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are worse things than loneliness,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;and, strictly speaking, we never feel really lonesome until we
find ourselves in the midst of a crowd. And we are never in better
company than when we take our place among the trees of a glorious
forest like this, where nature has so plentifully bestowed her choicest
gifts. I never felt lonesome since I left the noise of the cities
behind me, and as I lie awake on my couch at night, I ever long for the
morning, so that I may hear the birds on the wing and the birds on the
branches singing their praises to the Lord. Aye<span class="corr" id=
"xd20e3596" title="Not in source">,</span> and I never tire of watching
the rabbit and the weasel, the fox and the hare, or listening to the
droning of the bee,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To live close to and feel the divine influence of
nature must be a wonderful thing surely, but I am sorry to say that
&rsquo;tis the ugly in nature that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285"
href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>interests me more than
anything else, and the sting of a bee or a mosquito affects me more
than the beauty of the sunset,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, man alive,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
nothing ugly in nature. And the sting of an insect, like the slur of a
friend, is a thing to be forgotten and not remembered. But for all
that, insects with the capacity for causing annoyance have their uses.
And those who never lift their eyes to the skies, so to speak, to look
at other worlds than their own, will never feel lonesome while they
have bees, wasps, and mosquitoes to torment them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the devil of a thing,&rsquo; ses I,
&lsquo;when you come to think of it, that man can never really enjoy
himself. When his wife or daughters, as the case may be, stop nagging
at him, his friends commence to turn on him, or the wild animals of the
earth, such as bugs and mosquitoes, will try to drive him to
desperation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very true, indeed,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;but we must
cultivate patience in all things, and self-control as well, if we want
to be comparatively happy.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286"
href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Patience,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;is the next best thing
to stupidity. And &rsquo;tis nothing more nor less than an infinite
capacity for taking pains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what&rsquo;s genius then?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Genius,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;is the blossom of
inspiration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am beginning at long last,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;to
see some of the advantages of being a recluse. It makes a man think
more than pleases those who disagree with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are still a novice at philosophy,&rsquo; ses he,
&lsquo;and when you can understand why people won&rsquo;t associate
with others, you will know why they keep to themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;I always want to be with my
friends, and live as comfortably as I can. But evidently you
don&rsquo;t care where you live, or how you live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I live in the present, the
past, and the future, and though I dwell in a hut at the foot of the
hills beyond, I am as happy as a cow in clover. And if all the water in
the ocean was to be turned into whiskey, and if all the fish and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>the Sunday excursionists were to drink
themselves to death, I don&rsquo;t believe that &lsquo;twould interfere
with my comfort. I have all I want,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and I know
it, and that&rsquo;s the only time a man can be happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why don&rsquo;t you write a poem?&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I live one,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s
much better. I love the rustle of the leaves and every sound in the
woods. All that grows and lives and dies interests and inspires me. And
the only thing that makes me sad is that I am not a vegetarian.
But,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d be one in the morning if I could
get as much satisfaction from eating a handful of hazel-nuts, or a few
skeeories or blackberries, as from feasting on a roast
partridge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And that,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;just goes to prove that
we would all be decent if our decency wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with our
happiness. Nevertheless, a man who can drift away from his fellow men
and live alone in a wood must be the descendant of some ancient line of
kings, or else he must be one of those highly civilized people we read
about in books. Or perhaps a species of snob who cannot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>see
the difference between his own foolishness and the foolishness of
others. Such a one usually thinks he is better than his equals and his
superiors as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very often,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;when nature makes
one man better than another, he thinks &rsquo;tis his privilege to make
others as bad as himself, so to speak. And to be a success, a man must
be a snob of some kind, or else have no more brains than a
herring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Snobbery is the greatest of all virtues, because it
makes us feel better than we are. Take the Protestants, for
instance,&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Snobbery is an inheritance with them,&rsquo; ses he.
&lsquo;And &rsquo;twas they brought democracy to America. And what,
after all, is democracy but the highest form of snobocracy? It begets
self-deception in us all, and makes the beggar think he is as good as
the king, and the fool think he is as good as the scholar. Aye,&rsquo;
ses he, &lsquo;and it makes the monied vulgarian think he is as good as
those who only tolerate him. Democracy only gives the downtrodden an
opportunity of becoming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href=
"#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>snobs. &rsquo;Tis true, of
course,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;that the aristocracy couldn&rsquo;t exist
only for the common people, and the common people couldn&rsquo;t learn
the art of snobbery only for the aristocracy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But good breeding will always show in a man,&rsquo;
ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;but some are too well bred
to be mannerly, and others are too mannerly to be just merely polite.
Politeness can be acquired,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;but good manners must
be born with us. The most ignorant and ill-bred are oftentimes the most
polite class of people. And you don&rsquo;t have to spend a year with a
man to know whether or not he is a gentleman. The very good manners of
some is the most offensive thing about them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis wonderful astuteness of observation, you
have entirely,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;and I think it is a shame for a man
with your insight to be wasting your time in this dreary grove, when
you could be giving pleasure and instruction to the poor and ignorant
in the outer world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why should I spoil the happiness of the
ignorant?&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;What, might I ask, has the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>world gained by two thousand years of culture?
What is the use of educating people who at a moment&rsquo;s notice will
go to the wars and slaughter each other for the sake of pleasing the
kings and rulers of Christendom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are a selfish man,&rsquo; ses
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Without a tinge of selfishness no man is any
good,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And don&rsquo;t you do anything at all for
others?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; ses he. &ldquo;I keep out of their
way, and you don&rsquo;t know what a kindness that is. Those who
don&rsquo;t bore me,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;I bore them. And that is one
of the reasons why I keep so much to myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why don&rsquo;t you keep a record of all your
thoughts and write them down in a book?&rsquo; ses I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I might be hanged, drawn and quartered, and beheaded
besides, if I were to do that. But, nevertheless, I have preserved a
few stray thoughts that may help to amuse the ignorant after I am dead
and gone,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are they?&rsquo; ses I. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are written in large letters on the trees of the
grove,&rsquo; ses he. And then he took my arm, and we walked from tree
to tree, and as we went our way, we read as follows:</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A democrat is one who is sorry that he is not an
aristocrat, and an aristocrat is a snob, and doesn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you think long enough, you will discover that such
a thing as equality could never exist, because we all imagine we are
better or worse than some one else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;People who don&rsquo;t think before marriage learn to
do so after, but better late than never.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If our friends were as generous as we would wish them
to be, we would have no respect for their foolishness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Flies never frequent empty jam-pots, but money always
brings friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The man who seeks a bubble reputation in the
newspapers must always keep reminding the public that he doesn&rsquo;t
want to be forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is no easy matter to praise ourselves without
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>abusing others, or to abuse others without
praising ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Speech is a blessing to those who have not the courage
to carry out their threats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Any fool can smash the shell of an egg into ten
thousand pieces, but who can put it together again?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When a man takes a false step, he must suffer the
consequences, and if he is sensible, he will do so cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Many say all the things they should be content with
thinking, and brilliance, within limits, often only leads to chaos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Congenital stupidity is such a potent factor with most
of us that we never know our limitations until we examine our
mistakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Most people are led through life while thinking they
are leaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;if we could only see half the comedy of life, we would
become pessimists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The man who could be spoilt by success would not be
saved by adversity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The great are not always humble, and the humble are
not always great. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293"
name="pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Silence is often more the sign of stupidity than
wisdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We can keep our enemies by continuing to treat them
badly, and lose our friends by treating them too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wisdom after the event is only
repentance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedad,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;he knew a thing or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about it,&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;twas by writing down his thoughts on the bark of
trees that he spent his time,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;And &rsquo;tis better a man
should write down his thoughts, and then forget them, than to leave
them die in his mind, or maybe eat into his heart and send him to an
early grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many a man went to his grave for saying too much,&rdquo; said
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And many a man went to his grave for saying nothing at
all,&rdquo; said Padna. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="corr" id="xd20e3735" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The cold has left the breeze, the lonely
moon sails over the hills, bats are on the wing, the owl rests on the
barn door, the badger is gone in search of his prey, the otter scurries
through the stream, and the nightingale with his rich, melodious note
fills the air with sweetness,&rdquo; said Padna to his friend
Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a glorious night for a ramble,&rdquo; said Micus,
&ldquo;and as we have nothing to do, we might as well take a stroll
through the woods, and we may find something to talk about. I too like
to watch the moon wandering all alone through the sky at the dead of
the night, and no one to keep her company but the stars, and they no
company for any one but the poets themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the poets are the best company in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>whole world,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;except
the dead and they that can&rsquo;t do an injury to any one at all.
However, the moon does be kept busy throwing light on a troubled world,
and sometimes as she floats through the sky I seem to see a blush on
her face as though she was shocked at the badness that steals into the
hearts of the young and the old at the close of day. Night is the time
that the Devil has his fling, and evil lurks behind everything that is
beautiful and enchanting. When there is no moon in the sky, badness
does be everywhere, and there does be trembling in every innocent heart
until the darkness of night is dispelled by the rising sun, and the
first chirrup of the birds is heard, and the cock&rsquo;s shrill crow
tells us that day is come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power and majesty of the sun is astounding. With a grace
and a gentleness beyond compare, he closes the door of night and greets
the waking world with a smile. And the man who can find pleasure
looking at the moon in a starry sky should be as happy as a king upon
his throne,&rdquo; said Micus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296"
href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Kings,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;are expensive ornaments, but
they are not always happy, if what we hear is true. And the only
difference between a king and an ordinary poor man, like one of
ourselves, is that we must pay for what we eat, whereas kings get paid
for eating, drinking, carousing, and doing what they please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real difference between a king and the common man is a
lot of brassy buttons, a high hat with an ostrich plume in it maybe, a
silver sword at his side, gold buckles on his shoes, and a few medals
on his breast,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does a king want a sword for?&rdquo; said Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well ask me what do we want kings for, and why
they get so much for all the things they don&rsquo;t do. And sure, you
wouldn&rsquo;t know a king from any other man if you saw him in his
nightshirt. Kingship is the easiest of all professions and the hardest
of all trades, because once a man is a king he has no chance of getting
a rest until some one fires a bomb at his head or puts poison in his
tea,&rdquo; said Micus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href=
"#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Padna, &ldquo;there is a compensation in
all things, and when a man is not fit for anything else, it is a good
job for him that he can be a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Micus, &ldquo;you never heard tell of
the King of Goulnaspurra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; said Padna. &ldquo;Who the blazes was
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a distant relation of my own on the wife&rsquo;s side,
and so called because he was the best man in a town of two dozen
inhabitants,&rdquo; said Micus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he do for a living at all?&rdquo; said
Padna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a mason by trade, and &rsquo;tis said that he built
more ditches than all the kings in Christendom put together, and there
wasn&rsquo;t a better birdcatcher in the whole country than himself.
Well, after he had worked some forty years or more in all kinds of
weather, he found himself at last on the flat of his back in the
Poorhouse Hospital, and no better to look at than an old sweeping brush
worn to the stump and kept in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298"
href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>the back yard for beating the
dogs. And there he remained pining away like a snowball in the sun,
until one day the doctor, who wanted a little exercise and diversion,
approached him and ses: &lsquo;Good morrow, Malachi, King of
Goulnaspurra,&rsquo; ses he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good morrow kindly and good luck,&rsquo; ses Malachi.
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the best news to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; ses the doctor, &lsquo;the poor are thought
as little about as ever, and the same friendly relations exist between
the clergy and the rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God forgive the clergy for their respectability. It
spoils some to make gentlemen of them,&rsquo; ses Malachi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; ses the doctor, &lsquo;but
now as regards yourself, I want to tell you that you needn&rsquo;t
worry about looking for a job any more, because you will either be
above with St. Patrick and his chums by this day week, or somewhere
else. It all depends on how you behaved yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you take a chair and sit down for
awhile?&rsquo; ses Malachi. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the first bit of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>strange news I have had since I heard that
England made the discovery that the most stupid thing she ever did was
to treat the Irish badly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks for your kind offer,&rsquo; ses the doctor,
&lsquo;but I am in a hurry to-day. I think that I prescribed arsenic
instead of olive oil for one of my patients in Tipperary last week. So
I must go and see how he is getting along, and if I don&rsquo;t get
there in time to cure him inself, I&rsquo;ll be in time for the
funeral, though &rsquo;tis against the rules of my profession to attend
the funerals of your patients, whether you are responsible or not for
their death. But &rsquo;tis all the same to us. We get paid
anyway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Olive oil is good for the hair, I believe,&rsquo; ses
the King of Goulnaspurra, &lsquo;and they say &rsquo;tis a cure for a
toothache also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Olive oil is all right in its way,&rsquo; ses the
doctor, &lsquo;but there&rsquo;s nothing like a good drop of whiskey on
a cold night if you are not feeling well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; ses Malachi, &lsquo;with reference to that
little matter, I mean my journey to the land of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>the
mighty dead; all I can say is that &rsquo;tis better a man should die
when he is out of employment like myself, than die when he has a good
job. But as we must all die some time, there is no reason why we
shouldn&rsquo;t emulate the ancient philosophers, when we are no more
use to ourselves or any one else, and shuffle off this mortal coil by
drinking our health, so to speak, in a glass of hemlock. Life,
anyway,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;is a feast for some, a famine for others,
and a puzzle to all. Some think so little about it that they are dead
before they realize what has happened, and others don&rsquo;t know that
they are alive at all until they are married. Howsomever,&rsquo; ses
he, &lsquo;our own affairs are always interesting to ourselves, so I
must now make my will before I die.&rsquo; And then and there he asked
for pen, ink, and paper, and this is what he wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>I, Malachi, King of Goulnaspurra,
bequeath the hard earnings of years of trials and tribulations for the
purchase of a stained glass window with my name at the end of it, to be
placed in the village church so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301"
href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>that those who didn&rsquo;t
give a traneen about me when I was alive, including the clergy
themselves, may think kindly of me when I am dead.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>To my son and heir, Henry Joseph Michael John
Dorgan, Crown Prince of Goulnaspurra, I bequeath, in recognition of his
indifference to me while I lived, one shilling and sixpence, and the
Devil&rsquo;s blessing which is commonly called the curse of Cromwell.
Besides, I am also desirous that he should inherit my bad temper, bad
habits, rheumatics, gout, and all the other hereditary complaints of
the family.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>To my first cousin Padeen Dooley, the King of
Ballinadurraka, I bequeath my large hand trowel and hammer, and to the
Emperor of Japan I bequeath all my old clothes, either to be used by
himself after the invasion of his country by the suffragettes, or to be
placed in a museum with other kingly relics, after freedom of speech
has killed monarchy. To the clergy I bequeath an abundance of good
wishes to be distributed liberally among the poor, so that they may
thrive on them in the absence of anything better. To the needy people
of all nations, I bequeath <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href=
"#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>the privileges of the army and
navy in times of war, and to everyone in general I bequeath all they
can get from their friends for nothing.</i>&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And with that he laid down his pen, closed his eyes, and so
passed to the land of no returning Malachi Dorgan, King of
Goulnaspurra,&rdquo; said Micus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303"

<p>The rich Irish humor and the delightful philosophy of Seumas
O&rsquo;Brien are to be found in the five one-act comedies that make up
this volume just as they are ever present in his fiction.
&ldquo;Duty,&rdquo; which is probably the best known of his dramatic
work, was performed with great success by the Irish players during
their American tour in 1914. The others are entitled
&ldquo;Magnanimity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jurisprudence,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Retribution,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Matchmakers.&rdquo; All of them
are notable for hilarious situations, clever character drawing, and
bright dialogue, some of it so delicious as to bear comparison with the
talk of Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s country folk.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
